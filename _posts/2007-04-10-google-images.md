<p><span style="font-size:100%;">I would like to enlighten you about GOOGLE IMAGES! </span><span style="font-size:100%;">Google&#39;s Image Search is the most comprehensive on the Web, with billions of images indexed and available for viewing.<br />
	<br />
	Today, the BIG BAD ADMINISTRATIVE CABINET blocked this HARMLESS website! Because &quot;</span>some of the preview information is unsuitable for educational use, and is offensive.&quot; <span style="font-weight: bold;">YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!</span><span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br />
	<br />
	Lets say I taped an offensive poster onto my locker. Would banning all students from using their locker be the correct step?<br />
	<br />
	Lets say that I was stealing chairs from the classrooms. Would enforcing a &quot;learn-by-standing&quot; policy be the correct step?<br />
	<br />
	Lets say that I said a profane word. Would taping everyone&#39;s mouth shut be the correct step?<br />
	<br />
	These &quot;administrators&quot; HAVE ABSOLUTELY ZERO EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH STUDENT BEHAVIOR. WHY ARE THEY MAKING DECISIONS WHEN THERE ARE MUCH MORE QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO DO THIS!!!!!<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:180%;">NO!!!</span><br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="font-size:100%;">They are taking an essential part of our education, and removing it. Sure, there are alternatives, but nothing compares to google images, or yahoo images.<br />
	<br />
	And the reason that they don&#39;t care, is because the district office HAS NO WEBSENSE! THEY AREN&#39;T EFFECTED BY SITE BLOCKING.</span></span><br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:180%;">GOSH DARN NO!!! THIS JUST DARNS THE HECK OUT OF ME.<span style="font-size:85%;"> and it makes my flash drive that much more valuable! :)</span></span></span></p>
