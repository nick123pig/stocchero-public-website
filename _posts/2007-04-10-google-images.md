I would like to enlighten you about GOOGLE IMAGES! Google's Image Search is the most comprehensive on the Web, with billions of images indexed and available for viewing.

Today, the BIG BAD ADMINISTRATIVE CABINET blocked this HARMLESS website! Because "some of the preview information is unsuitable for educational use, and is offensive." YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! 

Lets say I taped an offensive poster onto my locker. Would banning all students from using their locker be the correct step?

Lets say that I was stealing chairs from the classrooms. Would enforcing a "learn-by-standing" policy be the correct step?

Lets say that I said a profane word. Would taping everyone's mouth shut be the correct step?

These "administrators" HAVE ABSOLUTELY ZERO EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH STUDENT BEHAVIOR. WHY ARE THEY MAKING DECISIONS WHEN THERE ARE MUCH MORE QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO DO THIS!!!!!

#### NO!!!

#### They are taking an essential part of our education, and removing it. Sure, there are alternatives, but nothing compares to google images, or yahoo images.

#### And the reason that they don't care, is because the district office HAS NO WEBSENSE! THEY AREN'T EFFECTED BY SITE BLOCKING.

#### GOSH DARN NO!!! THIS JUST DARNS THE HECK OUT OF ME. and it makes my flash drive that much more valuable! :)
