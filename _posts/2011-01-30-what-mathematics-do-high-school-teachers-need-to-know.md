			After reading the article <i>What Mathematics Do High School Teachers Need to Know?</i> by Gilbert and Coomes, some points jumped out to me as being very much connected to the principle of teaching, specifically, fostering an effective learning environment. The article points out how a 5-year teacher of mathematics was pushed to the limits when students questioned her deeper understanding of mathematics knowledge. The article demonstrated how a simple question about proportions could be answered using 4 different problem-solving methods. I see this example as a concrete of example of the importance of the principle of teaching. An ineffective teacher would be angry and claim that there is only one way to solve the problem: the way that the ineffective teacher prefers. However, the effective teacher has set up a learning environment that encourages and supports student feedback and discussion, a broader understanding of the concept of proportions will result.</div>

			The article quoted a study which stated &quot;how teachers hold knowledge may matter more than how much knowledge they hold&quot; (Hill and Ball 2004). The deeper meaning of this quote made me take a step back and think critically about it. I feel that this quote can be used to sum up the principle of teaching almost entirely. Knowing how a human holds knowledge is much more important than the knowledge they hold. An effective teacher will be able to explore how to get their students to hold their knowledge, rather than worrying about the quantity of it.</div>
