Cheese! I finally have some time to sit down and blog it up. Since my last blog, I have graduated high school, gotten a haircut, grilled 67 cheeseburgers, received 42 greeting cards, and added 55 more songs to iTunes!

Over the past 2 weeks, I have felt almost gluttonous. I have gotten so many awards, recognitions, gifts, and hurrays that I don't know what to do. My mom jokes that you should add an A to my middle name, so I will be Nicholas Award Stocchero. Hilarious.

I was talking to my coworker yesterday (I feel like a business professional), and he has a different way of looking at all the awards. He was telling me that all he wants is to do his work. He absolutely hates getting recognized. At some points, I feel the same way. People keep telling me that I need to be recognized, but there are some where I feel like it is too much. There is always going to be that one person sitting in the crowd that thinks they should be recognized too, or is absolutely tired of hearing about you. A lot of people were angry about that with the SAC people during graduation. That's when I feel bad. There is a fine line to enjoy your awards, I hope I haven't crossed it. Now I gotta go eat my Red/White Award Cake!
