Personally, I think this is the funniest story to hit the internet in a LONG time. Just because I am a nerd

Anyways.....

Two new formats for DVD are coming out, Blu-ray and HD-DVD. Each has a method of stopping duplication of that DVD (it's sort of like a password). This password is like super high-class confidential, only the manufacturers of the players should know this code.

Well, as we all know, people are smart. Someone cracked the password for the HD-DVD. They posted their crack on the site digg.com (where users submit relevant news). Lots of people "dugg" this story. I obviously won't post the password, otherwise the beloved stoccheroblog will be taken down.

Then the big old mean executives found out that this password had been leaked. They called all the right people, and asked all the websites to remove the password. Digg.com removed the password from their story list. Being a user-driven website, not too many people took kindly to it. Many people started to resubmit the story. Digg kept taking them down. This happened all day while I was at school. Then, everyone went home and went to bed. Well real nerds stay up late, and they submitted more stories with the password, but with clever twists:

> "Best Buy Coupon code XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX, enter this coupon code and all HD-DVD's will be free on your purchase"

> "GoDaddy Coupon code XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"

> "INTERNET IS CLOSED DUE TO XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"

The digg.com guys woke in the morning, and realized that their entire frontpage was littered with these types of stories. In a true gutsy move, the creator of digg said (in his blog)
 
> "But now, after seeing hundreds of stories and reading thousands of comments, you’ve made it clear. You’d rather see Digg go down fighting than bow down to a bigger company. We hear you, and effective immediately we won’t delete stories or comments containing the code and will deal with whatever the consequences might be. If we lose, then what the hell, at least we died trying."

Ahhhh the true power of democracy. Just makes you want to go buy a Blu-ray disc, doesn't it? Sorry for the nerd joke.
