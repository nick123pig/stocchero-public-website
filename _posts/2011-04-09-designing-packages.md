<p><i>Type of Modeling being Done</i></p>
<div>
	<br />
	<div>
		The students are modeling area of faces, surface area, and volume of rectangular prisms by using unifix cubes. Rather than doing tedious calculations, students can easily count area, volume, and surface area by hand. However, the main form of modeling done is using the cubes to represent the volume. Students place their findings into a table, and then try to make conjectures and generalize formulas for area of faces, surface area, and volume of the rectangular prisms. The students did this in groups, and then were asked to share how they derived the formulas in front of the class. Many different groups had different methods of deriving the formula.<br />

			<i>How Students are Moving among the Various Representations</i></div>
		<div>
			Obviously, students are taking their real-life models, and extracting the length, width, height, face area, surface area, and volume to place in their table. This procedure is moving from model to table. When the teacher brought the students back into the library, they were working in the reverse direction. There were two instances that I thought were quite rewarding had I been the teacher. At one point, a student finally realized the volume will always be 24 since we are working with 24 cubes. That is an important mathematical concept that the student discovered on their own. The other rewarding moment is when students started to make non-rectangular prisms, and rather started stacking rectangular prisms on top of each other with different orientations. Even though we didn&#39;t have a formula, students were able to count area of the faces, surface area, and volume to place in their table. This is one of the many strengths of the model.</div>

			<i>What other Questions could be Asked</i></div>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Are cereal boxes the most efficient way to store cereal? Can you find a more efficient way? Why might this not work?</li>
				<li>
					Can you create an equation to solve for a missing side length given the area of a face? surface area? volume?</li>
			</ul>

			<i>How would you Move the Situation up for High School Students</i></div>
	</div>

	I think the obvious way to raise the level of this modeling activity is to introduce optimization, maximization, and minimization. Start adding costs to the construction of the box. How can we minimize the cost, while maximizing the storage?</div>
