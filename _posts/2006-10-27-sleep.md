There are so many good things that I like. For example, I like pretzels, shampoo, and water. But there is just one thing that takes the cake for everything. Something so under appreciated by everyone, that I savor every moment of.

I will be straight forward: Sleep is the best thing in the entire world! I LOVE SLEEP. Naps and Snoozes - Can't Get Enough! There are so many good things that come from sleep. In fact, there are FOUR!
- Sheep would definitely not be as popular as they are now if it wasn't for sleep.
- Sleep has impacted the US Economy immensely thanks to great inventions like the "Alarm" Clock, and such patented devices as SNORE-NO-MORE
- Dreams are just fun.
- Pillows and Blankets would feel lonely and sad if no one was sleeping, so it's good to keep them company.

Sometimes I ponder to myself, "WHY AM I NOT SLEEPING" or "IF I SLEEP NOW, WILL I IMPROVE THE SITUATION?". Some people say you will just become a lazy bum if all you do is sleep, but I say PHOOEY! Sleep ROX!
