<p>There are so many good things that I like. For example, I like pretzels, shampoo, and water. But there is just one thing that takes the cake for everything. Something so under appreciated by everyone, that I savor every moment of.<br />
	<br />
	I will be straight forward: Sleep is the best thing in the entire world! I LOVE SLEEP. Naps and Snoozes - Can&#39;t Get Enough! There are so many good things that come from sleep. In fact, there are FOUR!<br />
	1) Sheep would definitely not be as popular as they are now if it wasn&#39;t for sleep.<br />
	2) Sleep has impacted the US Economy immensely thanks to great inventions like the &quot;Alarm&quot; Clock, and such patented devices as SNORE-NO-MORE<br />
	3) Dreams are just fun.<br />
	4) Pillows and Blankets would feel lonely and sad if no one was sleeping, so it&#39;s good to keep them company.<br />
	<br />
	Sometimes I ponder to myself, &quot;WHY AM I NOT SLEEPING&quot; or &quot;IF I SLEEP NOW, WILL I IMPROVE THE SITUATION?&quot;. Some people say you will just become a lazy bum if all you do is sleep, but I say PHOOEY! Sleep ROX!</p>
