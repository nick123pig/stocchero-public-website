<p>I am a lucky person.<br />
	Here is what I do during a normal weekday.<br />
	- Wake up at 7:00<br />
	- Hit the Snooze Button Twice<br />
	- Move out of Bed at about 7:10<br />
	- Shower and Eat Waffles (Blueberry Waffles on Monday, Plain Waffles Every Other Day)<br />
	- Leave for School at 7:30<br />
	- Follow a bunch of bad drivers down Washington<br />
	- Arrive at school at about 7:35<br />
	- Park in my totally awesome parking spot<br />
	- 1st Hour - Go to Gym, Sweat Profusely<br />
	- 2nd Hour - Go to Physics. Physics is an interesting class, because we still have not learned anything this year. Oh Well!<br />
	- 3rd Hour - Go to Essay Writing! (Obviously the highlight of my day) This class is also important because it is the last &quot;real&quot; academic challenge of my day<br />
	- 4th Hour - I kind of creep around the school doing funny oddjobs. I sometimes just watch ESPN.<br />
	- 5th Hour - Go out to lunch. Boy do I love lunch! Eating is so much fun.<br />
	- 6th Hour - I get to go to Photo, but it&#39;s easy and fun.<br />
	After 6th Hour, I am officially done with academics! I then will walk over to the Stadium, and play with telephones--And I get paid to do it!<br />
	I will come home around 6:30, and write blogs all night. Then I go to sleep at 9:00<br />
	And do it all over again<br />
	<br />
	Like I said, I am lucky.</p>
