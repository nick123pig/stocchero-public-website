I am a lucky person. Here is what I do during a normal weekday.

- Wake up at 7:00
- Hit the Snooze Button Twice
- Move out of Bed at about 7:10
- Shower and Eat Waffles (Blueberry Waffles on Monday, Plain Waffles Every Other Day)
- Leave for School at 7:30
- Follow a bunch of bad drivers down Washington
- Arrive at school at about 7:35
- Park in my totally awesome parking spot
- 1st Hour - Go to Gym, Sweat Profusely
- 2nd Hour - Go to Physics. Physics is an interesting class, because we still have not learned anything this year. Oh Well!
- 3rd Hour - Go to Essay Writing! (Obviously the highlight of my day) This class is also important because it is the last "real" academic challenge of my day
- 4th Hour - I kind of creep around the school doing funny oddjobs. I sometimes just watch ESPN.
- 5th Hour - Go out to lunch. Boy do I love lunch! Eating is so much fun.
- 6th Hour - I get to go to Photo, but it's easy and fun.
After 6th Hour, I am officially done with academics! I then will walk over to the Stadium, and play with telephones--And I get paid to do it!

I will come home around 6:30, and write blogs all night. Then I go to sleep at 9:00. 

And do it all over again

Like I said, I am lucky.
