<p>I&#39;ve been alive for 22 years now, and I&#39;ve spent a good part of my time of life in a classroom. Recently I&#39;ve been thinking about my retention of everything I&#39;ve learned. For example....I took a class about Latin American history last semester. Do I remember anything about it? Nope. The reason was probably because the teacher lectured and talked about her love for Latin America. So here is my groundbreaking theme for this post. I don&#39;t learn things well unless I actually do them myself. I learn things even better if I fail and screw up.<br />
	<br />
	Example...I don&#39;t consider myself an expert when it comes to relationships. I&#39;ve had so many &quot;teachers&quot; try to teach me things about relationships, but for some reason I just can&#39;t learn from someone else&#39;s advice or mistakes; I have to make them myself. Yes, it sucks that some of my mistakes affect others, but I wouldn&#39;t have learned else wise. I guess that&#39;s a little selfish, but I&#39;m trying to start thinking about that sort of stuff.<br />

	So anyways, if you are looking to learn something...just try it. Even if the worse thing in the world happens, you will be richer for the experience and have a personal lens to see the situation through.</p>
