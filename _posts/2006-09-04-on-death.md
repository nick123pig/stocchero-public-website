<p>Its funny how when someone dies, everyone was their friend. Chris Williams was in my junior high classes, and he went to central for about 3 weeks freshman year. He died in a car accident about one week ago, and it&#39;s funny how everyone reacted. People who didn&#39;t even know him had something to say about him, and acted like his friend. That cheeses me off! Instead of recollecting after the person is dead, why not make an impact on them while they are alive? It&#39;s OK to remember after the person is gone, but you should make the most of what you have with that person while your here on earth. It&#39;s not a problem, it&#39;s just interesting.</p>
