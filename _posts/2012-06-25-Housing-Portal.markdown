description: |
    I developed an all-in-one web application for the department of Residential Living at Bradley University. The application is currently in use by over 200 employees, as well as school administration. The application gets over 1,000 visits and 5,000 page views per week. The application is built off of Drupal, and is tied into the school's student information system.

    The project is protected by FERPA, so I can't share screenshots or examples. 

    Among the features provided by the portal: Housing Roster, Picture Viewer, Mailroom, Incident Reporting and Workflow, Office Tasks, Activty Programming Tracking
