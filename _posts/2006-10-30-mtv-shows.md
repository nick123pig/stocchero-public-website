<p>Speaking of MTV shows that are Stupid. I will give you TWO (count them) TWO more shows that are so stupid/scripted/fake/dumb/bad shows.</p>
<p>#1) PIMP MY RIDE<br />
	(A Typical Show)<br />
	Xibit: Yo, Wazzup this is Xibit, I am gonna Pimp this ride. Let&#39;s go Knock on this Kids door.<br />
	Jeremy: AHHHHHHH! I am already wearing a microphone, but I am acting suprised!<br />
	Xhibit: Yo, your car is a piece! Im gonna take it.<br />
	[Drives to Shop]<br />
	[As he pulls in, all the staff yell obnoxiously, and pretend it&#39;s the worst thing ever]<br />
	Then everyone sits down at a &quot;board&quot; meeting<br />
	Then they fix the car.<br />
	Jeremy comes back and goes berzerk (a fake berzerk)<br />
	Jeremy: Whoa man. Thank you West Coast Customs, Thank you Xhibit.<br />
	Xhibit: Yo man, heres the keys, and you officially been pimped.</p>
<p>#2) PARENTAL CONTROL<br />
	So theres a girl with a fake bad boyfriend. Her parents choose two cool boyfriends, and they all go on dates. Blah blah blah. Then they come back. Then she chooses the old boyfriend after a long period of silence.<br />
	<br />
	There are so many shows that are all the same on MTV. GOSH! Room Raiders, NeXt. I could go on and on. MTV Corrupts!</p>
