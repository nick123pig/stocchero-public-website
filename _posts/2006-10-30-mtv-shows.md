Speaking of MTV shows that are Stupid. I will give you TWO (count them) TWO more shows that are so stupid/scripted/fake/dumb/bad shows.

1) PIMP MY RIDE

(A Typical Show)

> Xibit: Yo, Wazzup this is Xibit, I am gonna Pimp this ride. Let's go Knock on this Kids door.

> Jeremy: AHHHHHHH! I am already wearing a microphone, but I am acting suprised!
 
> Xhibit: Yo, your car is a piece! Im gonna take it.

> [Drives to Shop]

> [As he pulls in, all the staff yell obnoxiously, and pretend it's the worst thing ever]

> Then everyone sits down at a "board" meeting

> Then they fix the car.

> Jeremy comes back and goes berzerk (a fake berzerk)

> Jeremy: Whoa man. Thank you West Coast Customs, Thank you Xhibit.

> Xhibit: Yo man, heres the keys, and you officially been pimped

2) PARENTAL CONTROL

> So theres a girl with a fake bad boyfriend. Her parents choose two cool boyfriends, and they all go on dates. Blah blah blah. Then they come back. Then she chooses the old boyfriend after a long period of silence.

There are so many shows that are all the same on MTV. GOSH! Room Raiders, NeXt. I could go on and on. MTV Corrupts!
