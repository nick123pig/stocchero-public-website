<p>This journal article highlights and exposes a new method that teachers are bringing to their mathematics classroom: Scribing. Scribing is having one student take notes on a tablet PC, and having those notes displayed on the projector for the entire class. The &quot;scribe&quot; role is passed between students on a day-to-day basis; thus, there is a new scribe each day. Following the class, the student&#39;s notes are posted on the class website for general publication. The author comments that since this is not a common practice in American classrooms, the instructional implications of the &quot;scribe&quot; model with a tablet PC remain under-investigated. The author then looks to provide examples as to how this model would be used instructionally.<br />

	The given example is that students are looking to find patterns about the properties about solving polygons (finding interior angle sum, exterior angle sum, number of internal diagonals, etc) for any n-gon. The problem is posed by the teacher to find general formulas for such questions about a polygon. Next, the students share their knowledge with what they just discovered in Sketchpad. The scribe organizes this data, and facilitates a discussion about conjectures and postulations that other students have. As the scribe writes, there is a linear log about what the students are discussing, and their conjectures. Using the discussion of their discoveries as a foundation, the scribe translates the discussion to paper.</p>

	I always had thought quite fondly of the &quot;scribe&quot; model, but I had never comprehended how technology can play an essential role in the discussion. First, I think that students are much more likely to take a risk about making a conjecture if they are talking to a student, rather than to a teacher. This would create a more self-directed discussion in which students would take more ownership in. From the journal article, we find that the scribing model is closely linked to the process standard of communication, for which I blogged about recently. I never thought about it in this light, but the discussions that students will have can help them develop their mathematical communication skills.</div>

	My only hesitancy is on the technology. In the article, Microsoft&#39;s OneNote software is highlighted, with a Windows based tablet PC. My vision for technology in the classroom involves open source software with technology that doesn&#39;t pigeonhole students into one specific method. As someone who is in tune with technology, I would hope that open source and GNU/GPL software could be used to accomplish the same tasks, if not better.</div>
