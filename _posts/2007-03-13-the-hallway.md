<p><span style="font-size:100%;">This was on my mind today - I told this to like 4 different people today<br />
	<br />
	I call this blog - </span><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:100%;">The Hallway</span><br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-size:100%;">Ah ha hem<br />
	<br />
	&quot;You know those days when you are walking through the hall, and you make eye contact with every single person that you know. Some people get the &quot;Hey Barry.&quot; Some people just simply get the &quot;Hey!&quot; (if you forget their name). Some people are purely body gestures (the fist pump, the fist pound, the salute, the wave, etc). Those days, you are just ON.<br />
	<br />
	And then there are the days that are the exact opposite. You will walk by the same people, but you don&#39;t even look at them. You get no &quot;hey&quot; -- No Nothing! It&#39;s a constant drag from bell to bell. Those days suck!</span><br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size:180%;">Why!?!?!?</span></span><br />
	<br />
	<span><span>Another thing about the hallway that I would like to address is the &quot;one-on-one&quot;. There&#39;s no one in the halls, and you think you are home free. BUT THEN!!! There is someone that you kinda know from a long time ago, or even worse a teacher, heading your way. After a quick hair, nose, and appearance check, you have to prepare for the impending moment. You can see him/her from like the other side of the hallway; you know this moment is coming. Throughout my years, it is important to remember 3 things:<br />
	<br />
	Initiation<br />
	Choice of words<br />
	Release<br />
	<br />
	1) The Initiation. This is a critical step in your meeting. If you set off on the wrong foot, you are doomed. The biggest advice that I can give you is to PLAN AHEAD. Planning is an absolute MUST! If you initiate too early, your doomed for a long and awkward pass-by. If it is too late, you will find yourself altering your walking pace to keep up. You have to get it just right. My rule of thumb is &quot;When you can see the writing on their shirt, it&#39;s time to initiate.&quot; Make sure that before this time, you are not making eye contact with the oncomer.<br />
	<br />
	2) Choice of Words. This is probably the least important aspect, but it still needs to be addressed. I have compiled a list of &quot;Good&quot; word sequences</span></span></span></p>
<br />
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:100%;">Hey</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:100%;">How&#39;s It Goin?</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:100%;">How are ya?</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:100%;">What&#39;s happening?</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:100%;">How are you?</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:100%;">(Simply shouting their name)</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><span style="font-size:100%;"><span><span>And here is the DANGER LIST - you never want to be caught dead using these word sequences</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:100%;">How was your weekend?</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:100%;">I haven&#39;t seen you in forever!</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:100%;">What class are you in right now?</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:100%;">Call me sometime!</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:100%;">Do you know how to get to the bathroom?</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:100%;">I saw your mom yesterday at the store!</span></li>
	<li>
		<span style="font-size:100%;">Basically, anything that would require a response of 5 words or more</span></li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><span style="font-size:100%;"><span><span>Stick to the top list, and you&#39;ll be fine. Your response should be a breeze. The key is to lengthen your response JUST so that it will take you to the point where you are in line with each other. Then, it&#39;s time for step 3.<br />
	<br />
	3) The Release. So many times, Rookie hall-goers fall victim to a bad release. They either forget to release, or they did not setup the release correctly.<br />
	<br />
	Case in point, you will be walking by a teacher. You come out swinging with a &quot;What&#39;s Happening?&quot; and they strike back with a &quot;Nothing Much. You?&quot; THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE RESPONSE HERE IS &quot;Nothing Much.&quot; A rookie mistake would be to say &quot;I just took the hardest math test ever!&quot; That would most likely throw your walking rhythm off, and it would most likely warrant another question from the teacher.<br />
	<br />
	The key to the release - Short and Sweet.<br />
	<br />
	These three steps will have you walking in STYLE!</span></span></span></p>
