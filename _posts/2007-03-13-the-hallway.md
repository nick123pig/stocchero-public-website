This was on my mind today - I told this to like 4 different people today

I call this blog - The Hallway

Ah ha hem

"You know those days when you are walking through the hall, and you make eye contact with every single person that you know. Some people get the "Hey Barry." Some people just simply get the "Hey!" (if you forget their name). Some people are purely body gestures (the fist pump, the fist pound, the salute, the wave, etc). Those days, you are just ON.

And then there are the days that are the exact opposite. You will walk by the same people, but you don't even look at them. You get no "hey" -- No Nothing! It's a constant drag from bell to bell. Those days suck!

Why!?!?!?

Another thing about the hallway that I would like to address is the "one-on-one". There's no one in the halls, and you think you are home free. BUT THEN!!! There is someone that you kinda know from a long time ago, or even worse a teacher, heading your way. After a quick hair, nose, and appearance check, you have to prepare for the impending moment. You can see him/her from like the other side of the hallway; you know this moment is coming. Throughout my years, it is important to remember 3 things:

- Initiation
- Choice of words
- Release

1) The Initiation. This is a critical step in your meeting. If you set off on the wrong foot, you are doomed. The biggest advice that I can give you is to PLAN AHEAD. Planning is an absolute MUST! If you initiate too early, your doomed for a long and awkward pass-by. If it is too late, you will find yourself altering your walking pace to keep up. You have to get it just right. My rule of thumb is "When you can see the writing on their shirt, it's time to initiate." Make sure that before this time, you are not making eye contact with the oncomer.

2) Choice of Words. This is probably the least important aspect, but it still needs to be addressed. I have compiled a list of "Good" word sequences


- Hey
- How's It Goin?
- How are ya?
- What's happening?
- How are you?
- (Simply shouting their name)

And here is the DANGER LIST - you never want to be caught dead using these word sequences

- How was your weekend?
- I haven't seen you in forever!
- What class are you in right now?
- Call me sometime!
- Do you know how to get to the bathroom?
- I saw your mom yesterday at the store!
- Basically, anything that would require a response of 5 words or more

Stick to the top list, and you'll be fine. Your response should be a breeze. The key is to lengthen your response JUST so that it will take you to the point where you are in line with each other. Then, it's time for step 3.

3) The Release. So many times, Rookie hall-goers fall victim to a bad release. They either forget to release, or they did not setup the release correctly.

Case in point, you will be walking by a teacher. You come out swinging with a "What's Happening?" and they strike back with a "Nothing Much. You?" THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE RESPONSE HERE IS "Nothing Much." A rookie mistake would be to say "I just took the hardest math test ever!" That would most likely throw your walking rhythm off, and it would most likely warrant another question from the teacher.

The key to the release - Short and Sweet.

These three steps will have you walking in STYLE!
