It's 11:30 pm, and I am waiting for a computer to finish loading, so I feel this is an opportune time to make my first blog entry. This computer sparked an idea about what I am going to write about. I constantly find myself over-extending myself to others. I will do almost anything if you ask. I would not be up at 11:30 if this guy didn't want me fixing his computer. I don't know why.
