<p>It&#39;s the end of class right now, and I am trying to squeeze in a blog. It&#39;s funny because I am always trying to squeeze in a blog. I am always rushed to do things at the last minute, so It has become a bad habit. The bell just rang, and I am still typing. Why do I keep rushing? The quality of this blog is really bad, because I am rushing. Gosh Darn it, now Emily is looking at me funny<br />
	Shoot!</p>
