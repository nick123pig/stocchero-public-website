title: I Want a Bird

<p>So, I decided what I really want for Christmas! I want a bird! How cool would it to have an animal that flies around and makes mockeries of people? That would be so cool! It could be a metaphorical inspiration for me (I can fly!). It would increase my communication skills (Polly want a cracker?) It would teach me some responsibility (someone has to clean up the dung!) and it would give me a cool new friend who eats seeds! Some people might be greedy and want some expensive phone or video game, but I just want a bird! And nothing else!<br />

	Oh no! My mommy just came down and read my post, and she says had that tone of &quot;no&quot; in her voice. Oh well, wishing never hurt anyone!</p>
