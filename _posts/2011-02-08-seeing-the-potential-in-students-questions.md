<div>
	Reading the journal article about seeing the potential in students&#39; questions really emphasized the need for good communication from mathematics students and teachers.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The article pointed out two examples as to how the conceptual ideas in a student&#39;s questions can be extended and reiterated using communication. What I really took away from the article was the point about how to use mathematical language to express mathematical ideas precisely. The article pointed out an example about how a teacher can develop a strong answer to a question by probing a students prior mathematical knowledge and understanding of mathematical language. Then, formulating another example that answers the same question, using different approaches and mathematical knowledge. By using these multiple examples of mathematical language to illustrate the answer a student&#39;s question, a teacher can facilitate mastery and understanding of that concept.</div>
