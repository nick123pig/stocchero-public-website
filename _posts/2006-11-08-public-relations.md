<p>I am fortunate to work around computers a lot. I have one beef with the industry however.<br />
	Windows is the operating system made by Microsoft. It costs a lot of money (around $200.00)<br />
	Some people like to download it, and not pay for it at all. Well Microsoft didn&#39;t like this, so they started putting checks on Windows, to prevent against this.<br />
	<br />
	Here is what their site says about using &quot;Genuine Windows&quot;</p>
<div class="mstagline">
	<span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Genuine Microsoft&reg; software is published by Microsoft and supported by Microsoft or a trusted partner. Using genuine Microsoft software offers you greater capabilities and easy integration with the widest variety of hardware, software, and services. It also provides the confidence of receiving the latest product features, updates and ongoing improvements to help keep your PC performing at its best.</span></span><br />
	<br />
	Now I don&#39;t know about you, but that sounds like a bunch of <span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span></span><span style="font-size:180%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">S</span></span>. If I were a corporate leader, I would have chosen something a little more honest and concise.<br />
	<span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">In an effort to reduce illegal downloading, we are introducing &quot;Genuine Microsoft&reg; software&quot;. This will check in your software with Microsoft, to make sure that you are not stealing the software.</span></span><br />
	<br />
	Boom! Simple, Short, To the Point! That&#39;s all you need. I hate when there are a ton of buzzwords just jibba jabba to convey a simple point. Its just crazy!</div>
