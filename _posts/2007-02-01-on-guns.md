If there is one thing that confuses the heck out of me, its guns. WHAT ARE THEY HERE FOR? For killing people. That's their only purpose. Why would you want something that would kill someone? WHY? We have a police officer at the school that walks around displaying his gun like it was going out of style. You wonder why someone would think guns are cool. I'm Serious. People look up to police officers, and would want to be like them (I'm talking in terms of junior highers). No wonder why guns have found their way back into the schools.

You would want to be school to be a safe environment, with no guns. But you enforce that policy with guns. It will never work!

Guns need to go away. In all aspects.
