<p>If there is one thing that confuses the heck out of me, its guns. WHAT ARE THEY HERE FOR? For killing people. That&#39;s their only purpose. Why would you want something that would kill someone? WHY? We have a police officer at the school that walks around displaying his gun like it was going out of style. You wonder why someone would think guns are cool. I&#39;m Serious. People look up to police officers, and would want to be like them (I&#39;m talking in terms of junior highers). No wonder why guns have found their way back into the schools.<br />

	You would want to be school to be a safe environment, with no guns. But you enforce that policy with guns. It will never work!</p>
<p>Guns need to go away. In all aspects.</p>
