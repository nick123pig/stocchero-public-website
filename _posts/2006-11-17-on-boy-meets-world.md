Ladies and Gentleman. I present to you the greatest TV show in the history of history. Quite possibly the most entertaining and useful show in the entire world. More entertaining than such popular acts as Borat, James Bond, and Wal-mart. Quite possibly more important than peanut butter. More popular than the stupid song by Fergie, Most aerodynamic than your neighbor's car. More technologically advanced than the NCHS CAI lab, more user-friendly than your local McDonald's drive through window. This is revolutionary! Most people did not have an aim in life before this show, but after 3 seconds of observation, their purpose of life becomes clear as glass. This show is louder than the subwoofers in parking spot 813, brighter than the lightbulbs in the hallways. I tell you! This has changed the world, and no one even knows about it!

The show is BOY MEETS WORLD! RAH RAH RAH! Let me tell you, I would come home and watch Boy Meets World all day and all night. But THEY CANCELED IT! SHAME ON THEM! Life will be over as we know it when they have reunion show. Anyways, now kids minds get rotted by such shows as "Laguna Beach"

What has the world come to?
