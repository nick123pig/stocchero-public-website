<p>Hair.<br />
	When I go to cut my hair.<br />
	The drum I play is not snare.<br />
	The scissors slice my every strand<br />
	To make my head look not so bland.<br />
	If you ever get to know me, you will find that I am a great kids poet. I like making stupid words rhyme, and then adding a stupid sentence. ANYWAYS.... I decided to take this moment to write about Hair. Yes, the dead cells that grow out of your head. I was looking in the yearbook, and a kid wrote the following:<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-family:lucida grande;">&quot;Nick, you are so cool. See you Around. --Josh (The Kid With The Hair)&quot;</span><br />
	<br />
	HAH! Josh. First of all, what a lame comment. Second, I bet there about 40 Josh&#39;s in the school, and I bet that 40 of them have hair! That will really make you remember you! That&#39;s like saying &quot;From Nick...The Kid With Clothes.&quot; How about instead of remembering you for a stupid thing like your hair, that I remember you for something more meaningful, I don&#39;t know.... YOUR PERSONALITY! If you care about your hair, All you do to me is scare (See, good rhyme). Make it so I don&#39;t have to remember you for your hair, but for you youself. That is why I have decided to buzz it off!<br />
