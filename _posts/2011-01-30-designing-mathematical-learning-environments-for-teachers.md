	After reading the article by Sandra Madden, I was somewhat annoyed when she stated that teachers frequently teach technology rather than teach mathematics using the technology as a tool. I believe that this illustrates an important concept regarding the principle of teaching: there must be mathematical goals that guide the learning of an effective teacher&#39;s classroom.<br />

	The fact that teachers are teaching technology, rather than using the technology as a tool to teach mathematics is a sad illustration that those teachers do not have mathematical goals in mind. Rather, they see technology as a cool way to engage their students and keep their attention. However, this methodology is self-defeating, as those teachers will probably lose even more students attention when they revert back to their &quot;traditional&quot; mathematics teach methods, since they don&#39;t properly understand the way to use technology as a tool to enhance student learning. If a teacher doesn&#39;t fully grasp how to use technology as a tool, then they shouldn&#39;t use it at all. I don&#39;t know how many times from experience I&#39;ve seen a teacher reluctantly use technology because &quot;someone told them to&quot; or &quot;it was just there.&quot; In those cases, I have felt disadvantaged due to the fact that I am not learning as much as I could if they were teaching the way they felt comfortable. An effective teacher would set effective goals and use technology to reach those goals.</div>
