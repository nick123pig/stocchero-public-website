title: Web Based Homework

<p>The article I read in <i>Mathematics Teacher</i> was about web-based homework. This is a topic I am sorely interested in. Rather than looking at what technology was available, the journal article examined if using web based homework was actually helping students perform better on exams.</p>
<div>

<div>
	Some of the results confirmed my judgements:</div>
<div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				About two-thirds of the students said that they liked being allowed multiple tries to submit answers and getting instant feedback on whether their answers were correct or incorrect. This same cohort commented that the Webbased assignments made them think more about their work and their answers.</li>
			<li>
				More than 70 percent of the students felt that the paper-based homework better prepared them for the course exams.</li>
			<li>
				When asked their preference, students favored each type of homework in equal numbers.</li>
			<li>
				A majority of the students (48 out of 87) reported that they spent one hour or less on each Web-based assignment, while a minority (26 out of 87) spent one hour or less on each paper-based assignment.</li>
			<li>
				Many students (39 out of 87) reported that they spent one to four hours on each Web-based assignment, while 61 out of 87 students said they spent one to four hours on each paper-based assignment.</li>
			<li>
				Overall, two-thirds of the students reported that they chose to work individually on the assignments; the remaining one-third favored working with a partner or in a group with other students.</li>
		</ul>
		<div>
			This brings up some important implications for teaching. First, having web-based assignments encourages students to work alone, as the randomization feature of the web-based assignments make it difficult to collaborate. Secondly, there seems to be inconclusive data as to whether or not test scores raise or lower. The article suggests that teachers experiment with these assignments, and see whether or not they fit the teacher&#39;s style.</div>

	I also want to tie this article into a video that I watched on TED. Every math teacher should watch this video: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education.html">Salman Kahn on Web Based Learning</a>. This is the same Khan that I did my video blogs about.</div>
