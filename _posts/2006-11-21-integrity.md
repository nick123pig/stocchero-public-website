	So, It&#39;s Sunday night, and it&#39;s about 11:00 pm. I am just finishing up my Cry, Beloved reading. I walked back downstairs, and saw that there were a ton of dishes. Our dishwasher has been broken for like 6 months (the reason why in my final blog). So I decided to do the dishes! ME! Take on the dishes without anyone asking. So I roll up my sleeves and get cracking. As I am doing the dishes, I kept running that stupid saying (which is so conveniently located at the top of this post) through my head. No one is going to notice that I am doing the dishes, nor will anyone care that I did the dishes in the morning. So why the heck am I doing the dishes? It&#39;s just freaky! I guess it&#39;s my calling to do stuff that no one will notice. I will be honest, sometimes I get angry when I do all the grunt work, and someone else just slides by. I hate that! Anyways......<br />
	Maybe someone is watching (and by the way it would make a great suspense thriller)?</p>
