<p>Boy! Who knew Tuesday&#39;s could be so fun! I was driving downtown to go see a concert. I was stuck in traffic, and listening to the radio. So I had a brilliant idea, I should call the radio station. So I did, not thinking that anything cool would happen. So a girl picked up the phone, and I told her, &quot;Yo, I&#39;m driving to the concert!&quot; and she told me that she was putting me on the air. So then the DJ came on, and we had a 4 minute chat, and then he asked me for a request. HA! They were stupid enough to put me on the air! So, like 5 minutes later, they played my little chat (but they cut it down like to 1 minute) and then they played my song! On the odd fact that Fook from Q101 is reading this blog, I would like to send you a gigantic Nick Stocchero &quot;You Rule&quot;!<br />
	HA! And the concert was good too!</p>
