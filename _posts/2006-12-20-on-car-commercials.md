As I sit here during this incredibly long commercial break, I beg to ask the question: When is it NOT a good time to buy a car? I do not believe that there is EVER not a sale for a car? People ask, "When is the best time to buy a car" and the answer is RIGHT NOW! From Employee Pricing, to Honda Days, to Free Guitars, to Year-End Events, to the Red Tag Event, WHEN DOES THE MADNESS STOP! The Day I die is the day when there is not a sale/gimmick going on at a car dealership.

And the ironic thing is that your car is just like computer. It will be obsolete in a month! All the car dealer want to do is make money! So what's the point?

Here's my philosophy: Buy a piece of junk car, and pretend it's a nice car. That way, your self-esteem would be comparable to having a new car, but you don't have to waste $31,000! GENIUS! As long as you get from Point A to Point B, you have just defeated the system!

And the Commercial Break rolls on!
