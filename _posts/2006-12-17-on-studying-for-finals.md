<p>So Finals? <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)">Pfft</span>. No such word scares me. I have never had to have a gigantic study session for finals. Why? Well, I have this ingenious concept: If you <span style="font-weight: bold;">LEARN</span> the stuff in class, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">RETAIN</span> the information, you don&#39;t have to <span style="font-weight: bold;">REVIEW</span> it all in one big chunk at the end. Some kids tell me they stayed up till 5:00 cramming for tests and such. Personally, I think it&#39;s better to go into a educational environment when you are relaxed, and confident; especially when you are being &quot;assessed.&quot; In fact, that doesn&#39;t just apply to students. My UNNAMED science teacher had a group of about 30 individuals observing her, and you could tell she was totally trying to be fake, and was too nervous. And not does this only apply in an education, it applies to life! If you are down to earth in a job interview, I would much rather choose you over Ms. Goody-two-shoes-pants-too-tight!<br />
