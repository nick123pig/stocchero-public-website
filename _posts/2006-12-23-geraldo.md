A plus of watching Seinfeld, is that you get to see late-night commercials. One of my personal favorites--Geraldo at Large!

When DOESN'T he reveal the shocking truth? His commericals are more entertaining than the show. I watched the show one time, and it was HORRIBLE! He uses the word "shocking" every 13 seconds! He is all build-up, but no results.

But! One could debate that no one watches him for the news, just for his mustache.

Kind of weird about the media, they can tell you what ever they gosh darn feel like, and most people will believe it.
