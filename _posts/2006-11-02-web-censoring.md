I found the greatest website ever. www.gethuman.com will tell you what keys to press to talk to a person when calling customer support. I don't know how many times I spend like 20 minutes talking to a computer, just so I could talk to India. This will save me a considerable amount of time before I hook up to India.

Speaking of technical related issues, the school district blocked my music requesting site! Bologna! They classified it as "Unclassified"! Sweet. Now I have to ask the superintendent to get permission to unblock it. That is so stupid! Tech department can block websites at will, but they will never unblock a website without the approval of the superintendent. The law says they have to filter sites, it doesn't say that they have to be jerks.
