<p>I Have Found The Answer to every single problem in the world! DRY HUMOR!!!!<br />
	<br />
	So you know the awesome guy on the Mac/PC Commercials? (The guy on the left)<br />
	<br />
	Well, it turns out that he is not just some crazy PC! He actually has a name: John Hodgman.<br />
	<br />
	Aaaand..... He has a book called &quot;Areas of my Expertise&quot;, and I would like to award it the &quot;Greatest Book of All Time&quot;. I am moving it from the &quot;Sort Of History of the United States&quot; by Dave Barry. Dave&#39;s time has come and gone, and now it is time for Mr. Hodgman.<br />
	<br />
	So if you couldn&#39;t tell by the commericals, he is hilarious! Aaaaand.... They just released the audiobook on iTunes for FREE! So I have spent the last 6 hours doing stupid tasks while listening to him! It&#39;s the first time I have heard an audiobook read by the author!<br />

	My post count is on the rise!!!!</p>
