I Have Found The Answer to every single problem in the world! DRY HUMOR!!!!

So you know the awesome guy on the Mac/PC Commercials? (The guy on the left)

Well, it turns out that he is not just some crazy PC! He actually has a name: John Hodgman.

Aaaand..... He has a book called "Areas of my Expertise", and I would like to award it the "Greatest Book of All Time". I am moving it from the "Sort Of History of the United States" by Dave Barry. Dave's time has come and gone, and now it is time for Mr. Hodgman.

So if you couldn't tell by the commericals, he is hilarious! Aaaaand.... They just released the audiobook on iTunes for FREE! So I have spent the last 6 hours doing stupid tasks while listening to him! It's the first time I have heard an audiobook read by the author!

My post count is on the rise!!!!
