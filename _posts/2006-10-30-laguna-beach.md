There is no telling how much I hate the show Laguna Beach. It is SO BAD! Worst show ever in the history of the world. If you want to know where teenagers get their cocky, spoiled, and lazy attitudes, your compass would point directly at this stupid show.

1) It fake. The show begins by saying, "This show is the real life of teenagers blah blah...." WRONG! Nothing is real when you have a full camera crew putting your every word under a microscope. I would pay everyone 5 cents if the show is real. NO WAY that it is real. 0% chance that is real.

2) It has a gigantic following, so everyone always acts/emulates the characters. Even though the show is one gigantic bag of scum. Here is a typical conversation:

> JD "I don't think Lauren likes me anymore. My Life is so horrible."

> Kristen "Maybe you should drive your $50,000 SUV over to her house while you talk on your cell phone"

> JD "I don't think I can drive with these gigantic sunglasses"

> Kristen "Alright, Let's Just go Party"

> JD "Sounds Good B****"

And the sad thing is that I come back to school the next day, and hear all the girls talking like that. The show teaches cruddy values, questionable morals, and excessive consumerism. Why do people like this show?
