title: Error Analysis

<p>After completing the two error analysis assignments and discussing the assignments with my classmates, I have a few reflections to share.</p>
<div>
	<br />
	For each error, I made an educated guess as to what error the student made and why. However, from my novice teaching experience, I have learned quickly that what I think is not always the truth. In a real life scenario, I would actually talk to the student, and ask them to walk me through their thought process.</div>

	This assignment also emphasized the fact that mathematics students cannot succeed if they do not have a strong foundation with basic skills. Many of the errors in this sheet were simple computational or conceptual errors. It&#39;s difficult to teach a student new concepts based upon old concepts if they are not strong with the old concepts. Especially working in an inner-city school for novice teaching, this has been a hard point for me to stomach. I have many different students who are at many different levels. Keeping instruction consistent yet engaging for all these students proved to be quite the challenge this semester.</div>

	What I will take away from this experience is just that...experience. The only way that you can become stronger at picking out student&#39;s weaknesses, is to look at many examples. When giving partial credit, it will be very important to understand the mistakes that students made, and to be consistent in identifying those errors.</div>
