<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">So I&#39;m sitting at the intersection of Hobson and Washington Street. It&#39;s like 5:30 PM, super rush hour, and I am on the way home from school. I just sat like 20 minutes and moved like 4 feet. A slow and steady rain slicks the road, and blurs my vision just enough to put the wipers on super slow. So, I get into the left turn lane, and I have a red. The intersection is super-jammed, there are a bunch of cars just sitting in the middle of the intersection. The light turns yellow, and one last car decides to block my path for a left turn. You can just imagine my frustration as I give this woman &quot;the glare&quot;. I have to wait another cycle to finally turn. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pfft. </span><br />

	<span style="font-style: italic;">So I&#39;m sitting at the intersection of Hobson and Washington Street. It&#39;s like 5:30 PM, super rush hour, and I am on the way home from the medical clinic. I have been working there for 21 years, and I have just be informed that they are letting me go. You can imagine my frustration when all I have done in my life is work hard for that company to support my seven kids. My husband is sick in the hospital, and all my kids are home alone. Shoot, the light turned yellow, I need to make this light. Shoot. Whoops.... Now a spoiled Naperville teenager is giving me &quot;the glare&quot;. Why me? Pfft.</span></p>
