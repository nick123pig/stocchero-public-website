title: Where Does Waste Water Go?

<p>So I&#39;m sitting in my basement, doing my homework, minding my own business, when a stench wafts across the room. ICK!<br />
	So I walk over to my basement door, and I am greeted by the pleasant sensation of about 3 inches of water around my ankles. Shoot! So I went out to the garage and grabbed the Shopvac to pump all the water into the sink. This very boring and repetitive action brought up the question in my mind, &quot;Where does all the water that goes down the sink go?&quot; Does it go back into the water supply? Does it go into the ground? Does it go into Lake Michigan? I have always wanted to pull a &quot;Honey I Shrunk the Kids&quot; and just dive into a faucet to see where it goes. Maybe I would come across some old moldy toothpaste, or some salt deposits. But as I was being soaked by the rain (which was pretty impressive), I decided it&#39;s better to be dry. So there&#39;s my fun, eventful, and wet night!</p>
