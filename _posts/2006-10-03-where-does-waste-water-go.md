title: Where Does Waste Water Go?

So I'm sitting in my basement, doing my homework, minding my own business, when a stench wafts across the room. ICK!

So I walk over to my basement door, and I am greeted by the pleasant sensation of about 3 inches of water around my ankles. Shoot! So I went out to the garage and grabbed the Shopvac to pump all the water into the sink. This very boring and repetitive action brought up the question in my mind, "Where does all the water that goes down the sink go?" Does it go back into the water supply? Does it go into the ground? Does it go into Lake Michigan? I have always wanted to pull a "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" and just dive into a faucet to see where it goes. Maybe I would come across some old moldy toothpaste, or some salt deposits. But as I was being soaked by the rain (which was pretty impressive), I decided it's better to be dry. So there's my fun, eventful, and wet night!
