<p>Let me tell you, my loyal reader, about my fun filled exciting experience with the Naperville Central parking lot today. Like most stories, it requires some history.<br />
	<br />
	It all started last Wednesday. Baseball in the morning (Blah). I got to school, and I couldn&#39;t find my parking spot. The salt and the darkness made it so bad that I just guessed, and ended up one spot too far over. I was late for baseball because I took so long.<br />
	<br />
	So jetset to today. I woke up super early so I wouldn&#39;t be late for baseball. I pull into the parking lot....AND IT&#39;S FULL OF SNOW! As soon as my wheels hit the powder, I just remember the back of my car fishtailing, and spinning out of control (It left some super sweet skid marks). So I venture over to the spot in which I think might be somewhere near mine. I have to stop and get out of the car to sweep away the snow to see the numbers and the lines (Keep in mind that I am the only one in the parking lot). So after about 15 minutes, I actually find my spot, and make a perfect entrance. Then I look at the clock, and I say &quot;Gemini Christmas&quot;. I run in like a freshman with my backpack, and guess what........I&#39;M LATE!<br />
	<br />
	And to add a footnote, I was also the last one to leave the parking lot. It&#39;s been some rough times between me and spot 779 lately. I might try waking up at 3:00 am to catch my spot off guard.</p>
