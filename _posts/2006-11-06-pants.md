<p>I realized something today. I only have about 4 pairs of pants. I have like 15 pairs of pants, but none of them fit any more. I haven&#39;t gone pants shopping since like 4th grade. But you know what? I am perfectly fine with having about 4 pairs of pants. I wear all four each week, and then the nicest smelling one, I will wear twice. The Stocchero Pants Formula = Easy as pie!<br />
	However, things start getting complicated once baseball season starts. See, baseball practices are always in the morning, and I have to remove a pair of pants from the rotation. What I normally end up doing is washing one pair during the week. HA! Genius. So that&#39;s my pants situation.<br />

	One thing that came to mind while writing about my pants: Why are they called a pair of pants? There is physically one piece of conjoined cloth. True, there is a pair of pant-legs, but there is only one pants. Whoever named pants pants, they sure pulled a fast one on all of us! <span style="font-style: italic;">Looking forward to summer!</span></p>
