So yesterday, I was sitting on the couch, reading my book. It was about 10:00, when all of a sudden, I heard a gigantic boom outside. Cool right? Well about 2 seconds later, we lost all electricity. There were no survivors.

So I continued to read my book. There was absolutley no way I could procrastinate. I couldn't fire up the laptop, I couldn't switch on the TV, I couldn't take a shower, I couldn't use my cell phone because it wasn't charged. All that I could do was read.

And the strange thing was, I liked it!
