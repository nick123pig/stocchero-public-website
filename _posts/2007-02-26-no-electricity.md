<p>So yesterday, I was sitting on the couch, reading my book. It was about 10:00, when all of a sudden, I heard a gigantic boom outside. Cool right? Well about 2 seconds later, we lost all electricity. There were no survivors.<br />
	<br />
	So I continued to read my book. There was absolutley no way I could procrastinate. I couldn&#39;t fire up the laptop, I couldn&#39;t switch on the TV, I couldn&#39;t take a shower, I couldn&#39;t use my cell phone because it wasn&#39;t charged. All that I could do was read.<br />
	<br />
	And the strange thing was, I liked it!</p>
