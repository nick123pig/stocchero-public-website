<p>If you are like me, you always are thinking why things are. So due to the recent temperature drop, I began to wonder why it&#39;s so freaking cold. It&#39;s strange, because cold is often connoted with bad things.<br />
	&quot;The cold man gave no money to charity&quot;<br />
	&quot;His cold heart did not offer to help the injured person&quot;<br />
	&quot;He gave me a cold look&quot;.<br />
	Warm is exactly the opposite.<br />
	&quot;The warm-hearted man gave lots of money to charity&quot;<br />
	So it&#39;s always good to be warm, Right? Why is the temperature outside cold? Why do we suffer through a period of frigid temperatures and no humidity every 9 months? Is it because we are farther away from the sun, or is it because we are being tested? That, my friends, is just a mystery!</p>
