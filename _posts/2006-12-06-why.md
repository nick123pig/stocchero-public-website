If you are like me, you always are thinking why things are. So due to the recent temperature drop, I began to wonder why it's so freaking cold. It's strange, because cold is often connoted with bad things.

- "The cold man gave no money to charity"
- "His cold heart did not offer to help the injured person"
- "He gave me a cold look".

Warm is exactly the opposite.

- "The warm-hearted man gave lots of money to charity"

So it's always good to be warm, Right? Why is the temperature outside cold? Why do we suffer through a period of frigid temperatures and no humidity every 9 months? Is it because we are farther away from the sun, or is it because we are being tested? That, my friends, is just a mystery!
