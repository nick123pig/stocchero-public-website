<p>Mono<br />
	A poem by Nick Stocchero<br />
	<br />
	I shared a bottle of water and my throat began to hurt<br />
	I couldn&#39;t swallow; couldn&#39;t eat; and had to skip dessert<br />
	Went to the doctor, drew some blood; feared what he would say<br />
	&quot;It&#39;s mono mono mono&quot; he said, Have a very very very nice day!<br />
	So here is me, sleepy and tired, sitting on the couch<br />
	I should become a kangaroo, cause then I&#39;d have a pouch<br />
	The moral of this story is, the thing that you should learn<br />
	Never get mono, wash your hands, and fill out your tax return!</p>
