Mono

*A poem by Nick Stocchero*

I shared a bottle of water and my throat began to hurt
I couldn't swallow; couldn't eat; and had to skip dessert
Went to the doctor, drew some blood; feared what he would say
"It's mono mono mono" he said, Have a very very very nice day!
So here is me, sleepy and tired, sitting on the couch
I should become a kangaroo, cause then I'd have a pouch
The moral of this story is, the thing that you should learn
Never get mono, wash your hands, and fill out your tax return!
