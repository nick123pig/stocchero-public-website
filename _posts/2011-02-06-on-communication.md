<p>Communication is one of the most essential pieces of education; especially in mathematics education. Without communication, there is no education. In order to grow as a student of mathematics, students must be able to communicate concepts and ideas clearly. Many important points about communication in mathematics education are brought up in the journal article <a href="http://nctm.org/standards/content.aspx?id=3484">Communication</a>, published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Reading the article, I found that the three most important points seemed to be: organization and consolidation of mathematical ideas through communication, the use of technology to aid mathematical communication, and the use of mathematical language to express mathematical ideas precisely.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<u>Organization and consolidation of mathematical ideas through communication</u><br />
			According to the article, students gain insight into their own thinking when they communicate the way that they solve a problem. Teachers have a responsibility to allow students to reflect on their mathematical learning, and accentuate the importance of reflection. I found it interesting how the article suggested to have student write &quot;journals&quot; about the mathematics that they did that day. I don&#39;t know if I would do this as a teacher, but I think doing something of the like would be beneficial.<br />

			<u>The use of technology to aid mathematical communication</u><br />
			Technology is identified as an important way to aid students in the communication process. The article points out that by using technology such as spreadsheets or calculators, they will become immersed in the language that higher-level mathematicians use. As students use technology, they have a common reference for their discussion of mathematical ideas.<br />
			&nbsp;</li>
		<li>
			<u>The use of mathematical language to express mathematical ideas precisely</u><br />
			As students develop, they will be intrigued to start using more &quot;complex&quot; sounding mathematical definitions. For example, when students first learn about function notations, they might only know f(x) as &quot;f of x.&quot; But as students progress, they understand that x is the input to the function f. This allows students to have a broad understanding of mathematical terms, and gives them the tools and logic to comprehend even more complex mathematical ideas. Allowing students to struggle with expressing their ideas can effective way to have students develop this usage.</li>
	</ul>

		The article gave me great insight in why a secondary teacher of mathematics should strive to have students master their mathematical communication skills early. Any strong math student must have a strong foundation in communication, and specifically work towards honing their communications skills.</div>
