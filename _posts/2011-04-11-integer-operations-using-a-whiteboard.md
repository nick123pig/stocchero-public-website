<p>The article that I looked at in the <i>Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School</i> was an article about how teachers can use an interactive whiteboard to improve instruction. First, the article points out the numerous advantages to using an interactive whiteboard. These advantages include the ability to manipulate graphics, ability to save and share whiteboard drawings, and the ability to erase the whiteboard quickly.</p>

	The article then shares a way to teach integer operations using the interactive whiteboard. Although the example was elementary, the author outlines a way to use the charge model of addition to help students understand negative addition. The author then talks about how to integrate the National Library of Virtual Manipulatives in instruction. While recognizing the power of technology, the author still stresses the need for detailed planning, careful scaffolding during the lesson, active student participation, high-level math talk, and reflective thinking. In other words, technology cannot replace the role of the teacher, but it can greatly enhance the level of mathematics instruction occurring.</div>

	In the article, I see many of the same themes that I have seen throughout the semester. Namely, technology is to be used as a tool, not the focus.</div>
