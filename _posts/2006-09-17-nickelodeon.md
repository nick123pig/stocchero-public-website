	Bored out of my mind today, so I decided to turn on the TV for once. I don&#39;t really watch that much TV because some shows these days are too addicting, and some shows are just plain dumb and stupid (such as Laguna Beach). Anyways, I turned on Nickelodeon. I saw some stupid show where a cartoon girl wanted to be pretty, was drinking coffee, and worrying about &quot;being with someone else&quot;. You&#39;ve got to be kidding me! Nickelodeon has gone down the toilet. I have lost all respect for them. I remember when there were cool shows like Doug, Double Dare 2000, Legends of the Hidden Temple, and Hey Arnold. There are so many other shows, but I would be here all day listing them. Back in the day, I would come home from school, and watch some good, old-fashioned competition on double dare, then watched Doug Funnie. Gosh those were the days. I wonder what the kids these days think &quot;Good TV&quot; will be in 5 years. Oh Well.</p>
