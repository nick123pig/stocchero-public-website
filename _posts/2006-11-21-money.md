<p>I am big at eliminating stupid things in my life. Stupid things are very stupid and unneccesary. There is one stupid thing, that unfortunately, I will not be able to eliminate. Money is stupid.<br />
	In a nation that is obsessed with money, I try to stay as far as I can from money. Sure, money is important, but it is so easy to cross the line of importance into obsession. If you take a moment to think about it, money is cause of every single war. People will waste their entire life, striving to get as much money as they can. Money makes people real angry, so angry that they will hurt and or kill other people. My thinking is.... WHY? It&#39;s so stupid! You could say, &quot;Nick! Why do you care about this so much?&quot; Well I will tell you why!<br />

	The struggle over money has played an important part in my life. A part in which will be revealed in my last blog entry. So that is something to look forward to!<br />
	Anyways, cheerio!</p>
