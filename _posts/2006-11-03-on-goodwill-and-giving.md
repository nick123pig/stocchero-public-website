Before I start this blog: A Disclaimer ------ I normally always give my change to homeless people in the city.

This story contradicts my disclaimer.

Anyways......So I was driving my mommy to the airport, and that was all fine and dandy. She got out, and I started driving home. Sound normal? It is!


So, I am driving down Cicero avenue, and I get in the left turn lane. I have a red light so I stop. Standing in the median is a homeless man, with a sign that says, "Help me please, I need help." He is shaking his change jar fiercely (not to mention it is 1 degree below freezing). He first walks by the first car, and gets no reward. Then he comes to me. This is awkwardness at it's finest. He slightly peers in at me, and I give him the cold shoulder. I don't even make eye contact. WHY? I could see through my peripheral vision that he became almost sad.

The fact that he was sad made me sad. What if this man had a family to feed? What if his house had burned down? What if he had kids? Then again..... What if he was going to buy drugs with it? What if it was just faking it?

This incident opened a gigantic box of possibilities in my mind. But you know what? It made me really sad, to see that a complete and total stranger was sad. So to myself I vowed this -- If someone really needs help, I will help them. No questions asked.

That was a part of my character, and I am bringing it back. And If I ever see this man again, I will give him some change, wish him luck, and apologize.

That is what its all about people!
