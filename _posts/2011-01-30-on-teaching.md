<p>In preparing to become a mathematics teacher, there is a barefaced obvious connection between the principle of teaching and being an effective teacher. In the journal article <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.nctm.org/standards/content.aspx?id=3442">The Teaching Principle</a></span> published by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, some important peer-reviewed points about the principle of teaching are pointed out. These points are, namely, a teachers role in fostering an effective learning environment, the determining of mathematical goals, and being flexible to student input.</p>

		<li>
			<u>Fostering an Effective Learning Environment</u><br />
			The article firsts sets out that there is no ideal way to structure your learning environment. Although having desks, bulletin boards, and posters are important, there is much more that an effective teacher should do to structure an effective learning environment. The article subtly suggests that old methods of teaching mathematics are obsolete; no longer should a mathematics teacher lecture everyday and expect students to take copious notes. An effective teacher will encourage collaboration and discussion, justification of reasoning, and fostering activities where students create and critique mathematical conjectures.<br />

		<li>
			<u>Determining of Mathematical Goals</u><br />
			A classroom should be open to discussion and inquiry by students, however, there must be concrete goals or destinations to which the discussion contributes. According to the article, successfully teaching mathematics involves creating, enriching, maintaining, and adapting instruction to move toward mathematical goals. An effective teacher of mathematics will create goals or ideas, and effectively communicate those goals to his/her students. I think that once students have a general idea of where they&#39;re going, then they are much more engaged and focused on the methods of how to reach those goals.<br />
			&nbsp;</li>
		<li>
			<u>Being Flexible to Student Input</u><br />
			This principle ties back to creating an effective learning environment. A teacher could create a very structured lesson, but if the students are not comprehending the topic, then it&#39;s useless to turn an blind eye and blindly continue with the lesson. Effective mathematics teachers should have the mathematical background to adapt the lesson in order to effectively reach all the students. The article points out that opportunities to reflect on and refine instructional practice are extremely important for teachers to be effective. However, students can sometimes become burned out by over-assessment. Effective teachers can informally gauge their students understanding of a concept by creating a learning environment that encourages students to question and speak about their misconceptions of mathematical topics.</li>

		Overall, one cannot underemphasize the principle of teaching as it relates to becoming a teacher of mathematics. Perhaps, it is the most important principle of all. One could be a modern-day Steven Hawking, but if he is unable to value the principle of teaching, then there is no way that he can be an effective teacher.</div>
