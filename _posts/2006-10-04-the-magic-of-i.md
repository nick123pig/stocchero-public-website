<p>As I am listening to an iPod, I went and checked my grade through iParent on my iMac. The teacher inputted my grade by logging into iCue, and using iGradebook. I quickly went on over to iwon.com to search up some news, and talked to some of my friends through ICQ. I walked over to my sister, and saw that she was watching I, Robot. (OK not all of that was true, but I think it gets the point across) What does the letter I have over all the other letters. All the other letters must feel pretty left out, because the I is having all the fun. Sure the letter I is sure important; I couldn&#39;t talk about myself without the letter I. So I declare this National &quot;NO I&quot; Hour. Try to not use that letter when you speak or form letters on paper (no wr<span style="font-weight: bold;">i</span>te) Get it? Oh Well</p>
