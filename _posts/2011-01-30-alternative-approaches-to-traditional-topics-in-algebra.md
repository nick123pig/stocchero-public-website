	Reading the article about Alternative approaches to traditional topics in algebra really made me think critically about the concept of being flexible to student input as it relates to the principle of teaching.</div>
<div>
	<br />
	The article first acknowledges the fact that there is no ultimate solution to getting students to understand concepts; it does require that the student perform at least SOME mathematical thinking. Secondly, the concept of status quo is discussed. Most experienced math teachers have a major issue with breaking the habit of teaching mathematics &quot;the way that they were taught.&quot;</div>
<div>
	<br />
	That is an important concept for teachers; they must be open to new ideas, just as the students are. I recognize that is a tough concept to stomach; I have trouble all the time dealing with change. But the fact of the matter is that back students are changing every day. To become locked in your own teaching ways with little to no consideration of student input is doing your students a disservice.</div>
