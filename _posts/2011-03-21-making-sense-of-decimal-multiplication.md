<p>I found the journal article about decimal multiplication to be very interesting. Novice Teaching in an 8th grade classroom has given me keen insight into this very topic. Most students in my 8th grade class do not know how to multiply decimals. The article says that in grade school, students are taught a series of rules and procedures for multiplying. Then, they learn &quot;tricks&quot; to help them multiply decimals. For example, students learn to multiply decimals without any decimals, and then at the end, move the decimal point is moved however many places to the left in the product. Many students don&#39;t understand why that trick works, and therefore, they forget how to multiply the decimals.</p>
<div>
	<br />
	To help students begin to understand decimal multiplication, the article offers many helpful methods. First, the author recommends working from easy to complex. For example, start with &quot;5 people have 6 coins&quot; and then transition to &quot;5 people have .60 cents&quot;.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Additionally, adding a real-world word problem for an expression can help. If a student is struggling with .39 x 94, a teacher could say each puppy weighs .39 kg, and I have 94 puppies. How much do all the puppies weigh together?</div>
<div>

<div>
	The author provides many other methods and ways that teachers can construct their lessons to help students make sense of multiplying decimals.</div>
<div>
	<br />
	One of the most interesting quotes came at the end, the author said</div>
<div>
	<blockquote>
		When middle school students represent and reason about decimal numbers and multiplication, they are less likely to memorize and quickly forget isolated mathematical procedures. Instead, they are able to construct a connected web of relationships among mathematical ideas and processes.</blockquote>
	This quote embodies the importance of instructing sense and reasoning, rather than just teaching silly formulas and rules that mean nothing.</div>
