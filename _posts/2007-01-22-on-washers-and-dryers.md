So I was doing my wash yesterday, and I asked myself an important question. One that could scientifically alter the course of history. _
Why are the washing machine and dryer separate entities?_

Why? Why can't they be together in harmony? It would be so much more awesome if you could just throw your clothes in a machine, and they would just be clean in an hour. Rather than switching clothes, and all that jazz. Things would be so much nicer!

People could buy two, and they could have two "all-in-one's". But NOOOO!! The scrubby washer and dryer industry would be in shambles!

Watch me, I'll change the world.
