<p>So I was doing my wash yesterday, and I asked myself an important question. One that could scientifically alter the course of history.<br />
	Why are the washing machine and dryer separate entities?<br />
	Why?<br />
	Why can&#39;t they be together in harmony? It would be so much more awesome if you could just throw your clothes in a machine, and they would just be clean in an hour. Rather than switching clothes, and all that jazz. Things would be so much nicer!<br />
	People could buy two, and they could have two &quot;all-in-one&#39;s&quot;. But NOOOO!! The scrubby washer and dryer industry would be in shambles!<br />
	Watch me, I&#39;ll change the world.</p>
