So when I was watching SportsCenter last night, I was quite intrigued by a certain quote. But first you need the background! It was a normal NBA basketball game, until there were about two minutes left in the 4th quarter. That was when Mardy Collins tackled JR Smith to the floor, and a gigantic good-old-fashioned NBA brawl ensued. Punches flying, jerseys streched, tackled photographers: It was TV Gold! So yah de yah de yah, the next day the suspensions came out. The leagues leading scorer gets suspended 15 games. His apology read as follows: 

> "I apologize to the fans, the Denver Nuggets, the NBA, and my mother, for the embarrassment I have caused them."

WHOA HORSE WHOA! Mom? Why mom? Why isn't he apologizing to his Dad? Or his Sister? Or his Aunt Gertrude? Why his mom?
