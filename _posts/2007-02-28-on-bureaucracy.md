So today: Lunch. Boy gosh golly, I love lunch. I walk into Taco Bell. Boy gosh golly am I hungry! But as I walked in, something disturbed me. (And it wasn't the gigantic bag of radioactive chicken they were pouring into the pressure cooker)

In order to fully comprehend this situation, you must rewind to last Saturday. I just took a computer nerd test, and my computer teacher and I decided have lunch in this very same Taco Bell. A disgruntled (and slightly kookoo) female employee barged over to our table to start shooting the breeze about how she hated her old boss, and how this manager just got fired because he was smoking inside the restaurant. I am not sure how sane this lady was, but she was just GOING OFF to innocent me and innocent Mr. Thompson about how she had been working there for 14 years, and had never received a raise or promotion. She was still sorting hot sauce packets, and wiping tables. 14 years! She was a little strange, but I couldn't help but feel sad for her (if her story were true).

So fast forward back to today. I walk in, and there are 4 (count 'em 4) big shot suit and tie managers back behind the counters. I see the same disgruntled lady, sorting hot sauce packets. But she wasn't just sorting the packets. She was sorting the packets AND getting chewed out by one of these "Managers." Curious, I asked one of these "Managers" why they felt it necessary to all visit at the same time. He told me that there were some serious complaints about the restaurant. Acceptable.

Now in no way am I a frequent visitor of this location, but all the people who work there are super friendly! I know this for a fact. These big shot manager men walked in, and probably treated all these employees like crap. Not to mention the fact that every worker there is of a Mexican descent, but you couldn't help notice the kind of intimidation that these managers have over all the workers. Totalitarian-like!

The point I am getting to.... It pains me to see people barge into a situation where they have no knowledge, and start making decisions; people who want to be the glorified hero. These big shot manager guys do not care one bit about these poor workers; all that matters to them is how far their back pocket sticks out. Not only does it apply to Taco Bell, but I get a taste of it every day! As I try to accomplish things at the school, there is a kid who wants to stick his butt right in the middle of my task and decide for me (Mrs. Green, you probably know who he is!). I recognize that fact that decisions are better when they are well thought out, and include the right people, but if you have no business, STAY OUT!

Sorry :) Early mornings make you cranky!

On a side note, I think on blogger you should be able to annotate the blog entry as you enter comments. I'm sending it to the manager!
