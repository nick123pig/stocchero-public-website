			I found that the article about the intersection of language and mathematics very much complemented one of the main points from my blog about Communication as a process standard. The main point that it really meshed with was organization and consolidation of mathematical ideas through communication.</div>

			The article was a case study done by a middle school mathematics teacher who was helping her students learn about integers. Her strategies included modeling, representation, and a heavy emphasis on word problems. She commented that using word problems is useless if we are only teaching mathematics. Personally, I agree. I find that mathematics can be greatly supplemented using the English language, because students seem to feel much more confident in their English language skills rather than using their mathematical language skills. Meshing the two, can build a students&#39; confidence in the latter. This also helps them accomplish the organization and consolidation of their mathematical ideas.</div>

			The article ended saying that allowing students grapple with the meaning of the problem and make sense of it is often the more challenging and time-consuming task. I find this to be very true, and the essence of the process standard itself.</div>
