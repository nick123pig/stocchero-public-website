<p>As algebra is most likely the first high school math class a student will take, there will be much development that a student will have to make in terms of reasoning or sense making. Initially, one might think that each specific scenario will be very separate from other scenarios, but as the book points out, this is not true. Many reasoning arguments revolve around the same basic concepts, and then use previous reasoning arguments to check work.</p>

	I found that the book introduced the concept of &quot;Extending the idea.&quot; In the middle school reasoning and proof process standard, we were looking for a specific discovery, and that was pretty much it. In the high school level, students are required to think beyond the idea, and see if they can make additional discoveries based on that initial discovery. I found a good example to be the section from building equations and functions. Instead of simply creating a system of equations to solve a problem, the book suggests that students look for different recursive ways to rewrite the problem. In the example, a constant term is &quot;chunked&quot; in order to easily set up a geometric series, and then that geometric series is used to find an explicit relation between a variable and a constant. Quite frequently, the book used a CAS to supplement the &quot;Extending the Idea&quot; section. I found this to be quite appropriate, because in finding additional truths about a concept can sometimes require messy calculations or large amounts of recursive writing, whereas a CAS can help combat that.</div>

	Another main point that I saw in the book was the concept of finding the most general form of the reason or proof. Yes we can reason a formula for the area of a rectangle or square, but can that formula be generalized to all convex polygons? This notion of going a level deeper to find the most general form of an equation or proof is highlighted quite well in this book. It shows example dialogues between students and teachers that helped me develop methods in which I would like students to develop their reasoning and sense making.</div>

	Overall, the book offers helpful insight for teachers to help students understand reason and make sense of the concepts they learn. The book did an excellent job in understanding the thought process of a typical student, and addressing some of the common pitfalls that students make in reasoning and sense making in algebra.</div>
