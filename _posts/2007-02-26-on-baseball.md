It finally hit me. It was time. At 4:30 AM, there is not much else that I normally am thinking about except sleep. But not today! Baseball season begins!

There is nothing that I would rather do than run suicides at 5:15 AM. There is nothing that I would rather do than take baseballs to the chest at 5:45 AM. Seriously!

Why? I don't know! It's like the curious cat that keeps licking the electrical outlets. I can't get enough.

And if our magical season last year was not enough, we get to do it all again this year.

God, all the things I have learned from baseball. I think the most important thing that I have learned is what it means to work as a team. What it means to work together to achieve something great. There is no hate on the baseball team. There is no talking behind the back. There are no breakups, no "He said, She said." We just show up every day, and work. We respect each other, we get along, we joke, and we play baseball. Not because we have to, but because we want to! Ahhhh, what satisfaction! One of my friends quit baseball because he could not keep up with the work, but I say PHOOEY. He can quit if he wants, but I will be there, licking that outlet. Now pardon me, I have to go to bed at 7:00.
