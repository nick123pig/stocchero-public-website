Sometimes we forget the true meaning of Halloween, so I made a handy reference sheet for you to print out and hang on your fridge.

- *H* is for the hats that people wear, and say it's their costume - when they really just want to wear a hat
- *A* is for academics (or lack thereof), which are not present at school on halloween
- *L* is for lunch, because everyone looks at you funny when you go out
- *L* is for laughing when you see ridiculous costumes
- *O* is what I said when I saw the Mike Stock Costume
- *W* is for "What the heck was the Newport Box Costume Guy thinking?"
- *E* is for Eggs - the inevitable amount of eggings that will happen tonight
- *E* is for Extra. Meaning.... the extra pounds that everyone will put on from sugar overload.
- *N* is for NICK STOCCHERO RULES!

Always keep this handy, you never know when you might need it.
