<p>Sometimes we forget the true meaning of Halloween, so I made a handy reference sheet for you to print out and hang on your fridge.<br />
	<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">H</span> is for the hats that people wear, and say it&#39;s their costume - when they really just want to wear a hat<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> is for academics (or lack thereof), which are not present at school on halloween<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">L</span> is for lunch, because everyone looks at you funny when you go out<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">L </span>is for laughing when you see ridiculous costumes<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">O</span> is what I said when I saw the Mike Stock Costume<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">W</span> is for &quot;What the heck was the Newport Box Costume Guy thinking?&quot;<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">E</span> is for Eggs - the inevitable amount of eggings that will happen tonight<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">E</span> is for Extra. Meaning.... the extra pounds that everyone will put on from sugar overload.<br />
	<span style="font-weight: bold;">N</span> is for NICK STOCCHERO RULES!<br />
	<br />
	Always keep this handy, you never know when you might need it.</p>
