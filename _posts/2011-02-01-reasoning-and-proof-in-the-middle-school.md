title: Reasoning and Proof in the Middle School

<p>I looked at the reasoning and proof process standard for grades 6-8. Students should be gaining basic mathematical knowledge such as examining patterns, forming conjectures about regularities, evaluate conjectures, and constructing and evaluating mathematical arguments.</p>

	The teacher plays an important role in developing a student&#39;s skills regarding reasoning and proof. Students must begin to start recognizing patterns and regularities on their own. Teachers must foster an environment where it is OK for students to make mistakes and make incorrect inferences. A teacher who simply provides reasoning and proof for their students is ineffective; students must be able to construct these ideas on their own.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	For the younger levels, the ideas are more important than the form. If a student discovers a mathematical idea, but is unable to formally write his/her conjecture, an effective teacher in grades 6-8 will be able to guide and develop a students formal proofs.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Choosing tasks that allow for these reasoning and proof skills are important for middle teachers. According to the NCTM, Tasks that require the generation and organization of data to make, validate, or refute a conjecture are often appropriate.</div>

	Personally, I really believe that technology can aid a middle school teacher who is looking to help their students develop their reasoning. So many different discoveries can be made by simply manipulating, for example, geometry software. I know from experience that this self-guided reasoning allowed me to become interested and fluent in providing reasoning and proofs for my mathematical arguments.</div>
