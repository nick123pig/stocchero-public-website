I wish that I didn&#39;t have a million things to do. I wish that I could just hop on that plane to Hawaii, and just sit on the beach for a month. Sometimes I wish that I could snip the phone line and just watch football on TV all Sunday. Sometimes I wish that I didn&#39;t have to wake up early to go to school, or that I didn&#39;t have to make my bed to make sure it was presentable. Sometimes I wish that the garbage would walk itself out to the curb.<br />

	But on these days that I think like this, I realize that my dream life is a bunch of bologna. Life is busy... and gosh darn it, so am I!</p>
