Sometimes I wish I could just get away from it all. I wish that I didn't have a million things to do. I wish that I could just hop on that plane to Hawaii, and just sit on the beach for a month. Sometimes I wish that I could snip the phone line and just watch football on TV all Sunday. Sometimes I wish that I didn't have to wake up early to go to school, or that I didn't have to make my bed to make sure it was presentable. Sometimes I wish that the garbage would walk itself out to the curb.

But on these days that I think like this, I realize that my dream life is a bunch of bologna. Life is busy... and gosh darn it, so am I!
