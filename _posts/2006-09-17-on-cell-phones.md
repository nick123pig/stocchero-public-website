Here is one thing I am really passionate about. Cell Phones! Boy Do I HATE Cell Phones! That's right! I hate them for two reasons. Number One, Mine really sucks, so I can never get called, or call anyone. _(If you ever get a cell phone, NEVER get Nextel)_


The second reason that I hate cell phones, is because they make everyone super weird. Sure, they keep you in touch with the world. But some people don't know how to handle them. Some people will text you to break up with their boyfriends. Here is a typical conversation on a cell phone. "Hey Girlfriend! Do you want to come to Jamba Juice with 50 of my best friends? We are all wearing gigantic sunglasses, and texting our boyfriends!"

They are an easy way not to talk to someone. Same with IM. Some people just look at their cell phone all day, and play their ringtones for everyone else. Boy, that cheeses me off. Number one, If I wanted to hear your ringtone, I would ask. Number two, Ringtones are stupid. I have a the good ol' generic ringer. I turn mine off at all times possible.

Here is the unwritten rules of cell phones as composed by me

- Never Take Your Phone Out Just To Look At It
- Never play your ringtone out loud, just so other people will look at you
- Turn your phone off if you aren't expecting calls
- Don't use text messaging unless you are desparate
- Important things (such as the meaning of life) should not be discussed through a cell phone
- Never get a new phone unless your old one is broken. Getting a new cell phone does not signify your social status, it signifies how spoiled you are.

Anyways...
