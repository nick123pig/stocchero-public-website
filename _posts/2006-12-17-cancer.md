What If! Just What if, cancer was caused by something common and stupid. Like what if cancer was caused by an ingredient found in shampoo? That was the single and only cause. That would be creepy. What if it was milk? What if milk was the only cause of cancer? After all these years of drinking milk, that was the cause. What if smoking cigarettes, or talking on your cell phone had nothing to do with it. This is probably not the case, but I have always thought about this when someone gets cancer. Maybe it's because they all used Suave shampoo or something. It's cool how creative you can get when something is unknown. But creativity can only happen when you ask ...WHAT IF!!!
