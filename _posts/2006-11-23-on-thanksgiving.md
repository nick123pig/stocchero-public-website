Thanksgiving should be a time of thanks and giving. A time where families gather around dead birds, and gain lots of weight while watching football. It's an American value. I love Thanksgiving! However, the next day, people throw these values out the window. Black Friday is gigantic scam. I will never step my foot in any shopping establishment on Friday. Everyone is too greedy; the stores and the customers. You just got done appreciating everything that you have in your life, and the next day, you throw money at things that you don't have. Maybe Thanksgiving is in a wrong place. Instead of just being a "day", it should last all year!
