<p>Thanksgiving should be a time of thanks and giving. A time where families gather around dead birds, and gain lots of weight while watching football. It&#39;s an American value. I love Thanksgiving! However, the next day, people throw these values out the window. Black Friday is gigantic scam. I will never step my foot in any shopping establishment on Friday. Everyone is too greedy; the stores and the customers. You just got done appreciating everything that you have in your life, and the next day, you throw money at things that you don&#39;t have. Maybe Thanksgiving is in a wrong place. Instead of just being a &quot;day&quot;, it should last all year!<br />
