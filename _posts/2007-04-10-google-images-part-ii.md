<p>To: ALL BIG WIG ADMINISTRATORS<br />
	<br />
	I am sorry to beat a dead horse. I know that you all probably have much more important things to take care of, but I am absolutely STEAMED on today&#39;s happenings.<br />
	<br />
	I have to start by letting you all know that I am extremely disappointed in your decision to block all image search sites like Google Images. You obviously have made an administrative decision, and I respect it. However, I believe that it was not made in the student&#39;s best interest. I am absolutely sure.<br />
	<br />
	You have announced to your student body that you no longer trust them to use the Internet. You have announced that you are afraid of a lawsuit. You have announced that you are too lazy to have staff members supervise students using the Internet. The Law requires you to filter obscene, pornographic, or harmful or inappropriate material. It does NOT require you to block Google Images. IT&#39;S GOOGLE IMAGES!<br />
	<br />
	In light of your decision to block google images, I feel you must now block all search engines. They too can produce preview information that is unsuitable for educational use or offensive. In fact, EVERY SINGLE WEBSITE ON THE Internet can produce such information. You might as well pull the plug on the Internet altogether!<br />
	<br />
	You will hear your fair share of gripes. I would appreciate to hear back from all of you, and I would appreciate you to be honest.</p>
