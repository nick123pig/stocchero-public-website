title: Strategies for Implementing Technology

<p>I really enjoyed reading this article, as it is aligned to my interests. The article points out how very often students forget the content of the lesson, and remember simply the technology. Instead of &quot;how do I solve this systems of equations?&quot;, the student will ask &quot;what button do I press to get the answer?&quot; The article offers tangible ways that you can prevent these sorts of situations from happening.</p>

	Before the lesson, the author suggests that teachers be very familiar with the technology, strategically pick student groupings, use ready-made activities, and plan to make connections around the lesson. Additionally, the author says to be willing to explore. I think this is one of the most important uses of technology in the classroom. Use the technology to show something that you couldn&#39;t normally show without it, not just something that can be done otherwise.</div>

	During the lesson, the most important suggestion that the author gives is to &quot;not press the buttons.&quot; Give students the reins; allow them to do the manipulation. A student is much less likely to remember the lesson if all they are doing is watching the teacher. Other suggestions include having informal checkpoints, and to exploit the technology to answer student&#39;s deeper questions, such as &quot;what happens when I do this...&quot; or similar questions.</div>

	This article gave me a slightly new insight on ways to integrate technology into the classroom. However, I think the bulk of the article was written for teachers who feel intimated or unconfident with using technology.</div>
