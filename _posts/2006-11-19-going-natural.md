<p>So my main computer crashed, and I thought that it would keep me off the computer, but I am just magnetized to be at a computer!<br />

	Anyways, I have another issue to address. You know what cheeses me off? Prescription drug commericals. They are so dumb! &quot;Ask your doctor about Vytorin today&quot; &quot;Ask your doctor to see if Paxil is right for you&quot;. Shouldn&#39;t the doctor be the one deciding which medication is right for you without you asking for it? America has become a &quot;take-a-pill&quot; generation. The general thought is that every known disease or problem can be cured with a pill. I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t think any 1-[[3-(6,7-dihydro-1-methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-1<i>H</i>-pyrazolo[4,3-<i>d</i> is going to make my cold go away. Even Tylenol and Advil, I ]pyrimidin-5-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl]sulfonyl]-4-methylpiperazinehaven&#39;t taken in like 3 or 4 years.<br />

	I guess something important to me, is to go all natural. That&#39;s the only way I know how. Oh Well!</p>
