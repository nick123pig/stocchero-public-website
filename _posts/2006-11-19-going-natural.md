So my main computer crashed, and I thought that it would keep me off the computer, but I am just magnetized to be at a computer!

Anyways, I have another issue to address. You know what cheeses me off? Prescription drug commericals. They are so dumb! "Ask your doctor about Vytorin today" "Ask your doctor to see if Paxil is right for you". Shouldn't the doctor be the one deciding which medication is right for you without you asking for it? America has become a "take-a-pill" generation. The general thought is that every known disease or problem can be cured with a pill. I don't know about you, but I don't think any 1-3-6,7-dihydro-1-methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-1H-pyrazolo4,3-d is going to make my cold go away. Even Tylenol and Advil, I haven't taken in like 3 or 4 years.

I guess something important to me, is to go all natural. That's the only way I know how. Oh Well!
