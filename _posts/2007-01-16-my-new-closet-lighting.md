title: My New Closet Lighting
created: 2007-01-16

<p>Basking in the darkness of my closet, I decided to do something about it today. So I went down to the local hardware store, and bought my supplies. (On a side note, If I ever wanted to get stuck somewhere, I would want to get stuck in a hardware store.) So I got myself a ladder, and did some extreme electrical work.<br />
	The Result.<br />
	When I stick my hand inside my closet, the light turns on, and when I take my hands out, the lights turn off. Videos to come!</p>
