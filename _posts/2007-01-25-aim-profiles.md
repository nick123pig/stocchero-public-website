<p>I have spent quite some time on the wonderful world of AOL Instant Messenger. One thing that I love doing is snooping on people&#39;s profiles. People can enter anything they want about themselves; no prompts, no criteria. You don&#39;t know who is looking at your profile, so you better put something good in it.<br />
	<br />
	My favorite is when people put things that make no sense, except to them!<br />
	<br />
	For example: <span style="font-size:100%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Sigma Pi F2K6</span><br />
	My best guess: This guy is in a sorority, and wants to filet two kids at 6:00 PM<br />
	<br />
	Another example: </span><span style="font-style: italic;font-size:100%;">i&#39;m missing you opa...</span><br />
	<span style="font-size:100%;">My best guess: This guy lost his favorite stuffed animal.<br />
	<br />
	Then, the only thing you can do is ask them! And they tell you so they sound cool, and then you tell them that it&#39;s cool!<br />
	<br />
	I don&#39;t believe in that nonsense. So..................... I will give you my profile:<br />
	<br />
	:)</span></p>
