I have spent quite some time on the wonderful world of AOL Instant Messenger. One thing that I love doing is snooping on people's profiles. People can enter anything they want about themselves; no prompts, no criteria. You don't know who is looking at your profile, so you better put something good in it.

My favorite is when people put things that make no sense, except to them!

For example: 
> Sigma Pi F2K6
My best guess: This guy is in a sorority, and wants to filet two kids at 6:00 PM

Another example: 
> i'm missing you opa...

My best guess: This guy lost his favorite stuffed animal.

Then, the only thing you can do is ask them! And they tell you so they sound cool, and then you tell them that it's cool!

I don't believe in that nonsense. So..................... I will give you my profile:
