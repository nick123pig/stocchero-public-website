<p>I, for one, am sick and tired of those high paid teachers. Their hefty salaries are driving up taxes, and they only work nine or ten months a year! It&#39;s time we put things in perspective and pay them for what they do... baby-sit!<br />
	We can get that for less than minimum wage. That&#39;s right...I would give them \$3.00 an hour and only for the hours they worked, not any of that silly planning time. That would be \$18 a day. Each parent should pay $18 a day for these teachers to baby-sit their children. Now, how many do they teach in a day.... maybe 20?<br />
	Then that&#39;s \$18 X 20= \$360 a day.<br />
	But remember they only work 180 days a year! I&#39;m not going to pay them for any vacations.<br />
	Let&#39;s see... that&#39;s 360 x 180 = \$64,800.00 (Hold on, my calculator must need batteries!) What about those special teachers or the ones with master&#39;s degrees?<br />
	Well, we could pay them minimum wage just to be fair. Let&#39;s round it off to \$6.00 an hour. That would be \$6 X 6 hours X 20 children X 180 days = \$129,6000 per year. Wait a minute, there is something wrong here!!</p>
