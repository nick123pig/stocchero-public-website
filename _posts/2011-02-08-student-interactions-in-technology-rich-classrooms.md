		Reading the article about student interactions in technology-rich classrooms really meshed well with my point about how the use of technology can aid mathematical communication.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		The beginning of the article points out a important, &quot;no duh&quot; statement: Students are more likely to develop a deep conceptual understanding of mathematics when they interact with and discuss their thoughts with others (Cobb 2000; Cohen 1994; Davidson and Worsham 1992; Vygotsky 1978). Using a computer in a mathematics classroom allows students to become familiar using programs and being active learners.</div>

		My feelings on the negative aspects of completely and blindly using technology does is that when a teacher who doesn&#39;t understand the use of technology in a mathematics classroom: It can hamper student communication and collaboration, which doesn&#39;t aid the student in understanding mathematics. However, a well-planned and well-though technology integration strategy strongly outweighs the negatives. The article concludes that the use of computers, when properly integrated, can increase student communication, and therefore are more likely to develop the &quot;deep conceptual understanding&quot; which is desired.</div>
