Have you ever wondered what the funny flap of skin between your nostrils is called? Well it's called a COLUMELLA NASI. Fascinating! What about the hard ends of your shoelaces? Well those are called AGLET'S! And suppose that your eraser fell out of the metal thing on your pencil. Well technically it fell out of your FERRULE! And has your pet otter left an unpleasant surprise on your couch? Well you go better clean up it's SPRAINTS!

I found this interesting book that has a bunch of names for things that you never knew had names! It has names for practically everything! Boy I would be lost if it weren't for names. They are the number one descriptors! If I had to award an excellence award for descriptors, I would sure give it to NAMES!

This kind of has to do with names.... I have always wondered this. Let's say there is a new invention in the USA (Let's say a computer). Who makes up the Chinese character? Thought-provoking!
