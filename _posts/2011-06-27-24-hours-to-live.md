Would you be OK if someone told you that you only had 24 hours to live? Yes. I was thinking about this the other day. If someone told me that I was going to die the next day, I'd probably be disappointed, but I'm pretty sure I've already lived my life to the fullest. I have clean water, I can communicate with the world, I've learned some cool things, and I made an impact on people. I'm happy. The people that are close to me know that I love them. Yes, there are things I still want to do, but honestly, I wouldn't be too disappointed.
