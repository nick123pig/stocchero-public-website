<p>Would you be OK if someone told you that you only had 24 hours to live? Yes. I was thinking about this the other day. If someone told me that I was going to die the next day, I&#39;d probably be disappointed, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve already lived my life to the fullest. I have clean water, I can communicate with the world, I&#39;ve learned some cool things, and I made an impact on people. I&#39;m happy. The people that are close to me know that I love them. Yes, there are things I still want to do, but honestly, I wouldn&#39;t be too disappointed.</p>
