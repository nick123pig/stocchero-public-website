<p>This post is courtesy of the hardest working man in show business - Simon Cowell! Lets get a picture of him to lighten the mood.<br />

	Anyways, as I was driving to school today at 8:something AM, I was listening to the radio. None other than Mr. Simon Cowell made a phone call to the Q101 morning show. I thought to myself, <span style="font-style: italic;">The one guy I don&#39;t want to hear from. He is going to talk about bad Idol Auditions.</span> Surprisingly, I heard nothing about American Idol. Instead, the conversation was about how Simon was a workaholic, who never gets a break. Then, the interesting quote came up. I believe it was something like<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
	It&#39;s sad that I have to do everything yourself if you want it done right. I spend 90 percent of my day fixing other people&#39;s mistakes.<br />
	&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>I heard that, and didn&#39;t think much of it. I continued to drive, and I got to good ole&#39; baseball camp. And it was at baseball camp, where I couldn&#39;t get Simon&#39;s words out of my mind. We had three other high-schoolers teaching the camp there, and I had to teach every single skill, because no one else knew how/wanted to do it. Then I got to thinking, well my dad is a workaholic....Am I one?<br />
	<br />
	And all I could think about was how true Simon Cowell was. What a joke. It&#39;s a sad world when a man who laughs at bad singers while drinking water from a Coke cup is my inspiration. I need a nap!</p>
