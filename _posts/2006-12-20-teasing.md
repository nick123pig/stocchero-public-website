See the great thing about me building up this last blog, is that you never know when it is coming. This could be it! This could be the gigantic super blog that I have been building up to this entire semester. These creatively arranged words could be the spectacle of this entire webpage! All my hard earned work thorough out my twelve years in public education could come to down this: This one blog. Every literary term I have learned, every extremely enticing vocabulary word could be utilized in this entry! All my foreshadowing can come to a peak RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW! This could be the one!

However, I am sorry to inform you, that this is not the last blog!
The last blog will come swiftly, without notice, and no returns will be accepted after 30 days
