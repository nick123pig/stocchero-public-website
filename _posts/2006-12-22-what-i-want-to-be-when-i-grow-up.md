<p>Pertaining to what I want to be when I grow up, I would have to say that there is a large spectrum of where I could fit in. Let&#39;s first start with what I <span style="font-weight: bold;">don&#39;t</span> want to be:<br />
	<br />
	1) A Politician (Except the President)<br />
	2) A Divorce Lawyer<br />
	3) A Salesman<br />
	4) A Consultant<br />
	5) A Cashier<br />
	6) An accountant<br />
	7) Pharmaceutical sales rep<br />
	8) Doctor of Medicine<br />
	<br />
	I have my life all planned out. I am going to make a gigantic internet company, and sell it for 1.4 trillion dollars. Then I am going to become a teacher. While I am a teacher, I will buy nice recliners to replace all the desks. Instead of giving out grades, I will give out my earnings! My pockets will be depleted within the first year! After about 121 years of teaching, I will retire to become a bus driver, and all I will do is smile and laugh, as my big yellow bus chugs along the road! I will live in a little shack, but I will be happy! I think it was Morrie from the book <span style="font-style: italic;">Tuesdays With Morrie</span> that said he could never have a career that took advantage of other people. Well I stand with Morrie!(and John Hodgman)<br />
	SWEEEET!!</p>
