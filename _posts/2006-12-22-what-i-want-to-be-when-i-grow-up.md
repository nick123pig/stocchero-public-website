Pertaining to what I want to be when I grow up, I would have to say that there is a large spectrum of where I could fit in. Let's first start with what I _don't_ want to be:

- 1) A Politician (Except the President)
- 2) A Divorce Lawyer
- 3) A Salesman
- 4) A Consultant
- 5) A Cashier
- 6) An accountant
- 7) Pharmaceutical sales rep
- 8) Doctor of Medicine

I have my life all planned out. I am going to make a gigantic internet company, and sell it for 1.4 trillion dollars. Then I am going to become a teacher. While I am a teacher, I will buy nice recliners to replace all the desks. Instead of giving out grades, I will give out my earnings! My pockets will be depleted within the first year! After about 121 years of teaching, I will retire to become a bus driver, and all I will do is smile and laugh, as my big yellow bus chugs along the road! I will live in a little shack, but I will be happy! I think it was Morrie from the book *Tuesdays With Morrie* that said he could never have a career that took advantage of other people. Well I stand with Morrie!(and John Hodgman)

SWEEEET!!
