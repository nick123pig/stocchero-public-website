I have always considered myself a modest person; I don't like to brag or flaunt what I do. But recently, I've realized that deep inside I really am always working towards that recognition and praise that an arrogant person gets. Perhaps I'm not as modest as I think. Perhaps, we all aren't as modest as we think.
