<p>I have always considered myself a modest person; I don&#39;t like to brag or flaunt what I do. But recently, I&#39;ve realized that deep inside I really am always working towards that recognition and praise that an arrogant person gets. Perhaps I&#39;m not as modest as I think. Perhaps, we all aren&#39;t as modest as we think.</p>
