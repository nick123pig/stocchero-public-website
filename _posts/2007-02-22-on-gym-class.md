Gym Class!

As I wind down my last 2 days in Gym class, I have to recollect about my times in the wonderful world of PE.

When I walked into my first gym class freshman year, the first thing that happened was that Joe Bunge called me a knucklehead. When I walk out of my last gym class on Friday, the last thing that will happen to me will almost certainly be Joe Bunge calling me a knucklehead.

That is beside the point......

Let me tell you the tale of the most horrific gym sport ever.

Floor Hockey. (Dun Dun Dun.....)

The only reason that Floor Hockey is still offered, is because it the most cost-effective sport ever. You can throw 20 people onto the same court, all with about 5 dollars worth of equipment. That's like 25 cents per pupil! Pure fiscal gold! If you couldn't tell from my tone, I hate gym hockey.

You may ask WHY?

I have taken Gym Floor Hockey 6 times (7 if you count roller blading)

- 1) I am sick of it
- 2) I cannot walk out of gym class on any given day without a gigantic welt on my left shin.
- 3) The following long story:

It was junior year, the 3rd week of floor hockey. Who else is the teacher but Smokin Joe Bunge. There is a kid in the class named Justin. He is one of those kids who is pretty quiet, and dresses as if black were the only color in the world. My team was playing his team. Yaddah Yaddah Yah, it's almost the end of the period. Justin has barely moved from his corner spot the entire time. Someone passed to him, and he had the puck for the first time all game. Me, being a competitive little snot, I stole it from him (gracefully, if I might add). As soon as I took my first step away from him, he takes his stick and just whacks the poo out of my left hand. OUCH! As if that wasn't enough, he takes another whack at a place where you don't whack a male. OUCH TIMES TWO! So I am in this gigantic amount of pain, lying on the floor, with a mad Justin.

The situation played out, and I walked to the nurses office. Justin came down and apologized - ON HIS OWN WILL! That warrants a Nick Stocchero forgiveness (kind of like the pope)

Anyways, the point of the story is that Joe Bunge was not involved in any of this. He was "surprised" when I showed him a gigantic blood bruise on my hand the next day. And in the classic Joe Bunge voice, he called me a knucklehead.

AND NOW, SOME RANDOM FACTS ABOUT GYM CLASS

I have broken 2 bones in Gym Class. I have never not been dressed for gym. I got a dance credit for taking Volleyball. I have had Joe Bunge as a teacher for 17 sections of Gym Class including all of Freshman year. I never got to take bowling.

So with that I say goodbye to you Physical Education! It was nice playing you!
