title: Why I Wear Shorts
created: 2010-01-19

<p>People notice quite frequently that I am always wearing shorts. Especially recently, I have been challenged on my intentions, and I guess I owe an explanation.<br />
	<br />
	To answer the question plainly: I wear shorts out of extreme respect for my dad.<br />
	<br />
	This is a particularly new phenomenon. I have not always been crazy about wearing shorts. In fact, sometimes I am freezing wearing shorts in the winter.<br />
	<br />
	To explain, you need to know a little background. My parents are divorced. Without going into much detail, it was a significant, life-changing event during my teenage years. Because of this, I don&#39;t get to see my dad very often. However, the times that I do see him, he is wearing shorts. It is a stubborn quality, but this stubborn quality has mirrored onto me.<br />
	<br />
	Wearing shorts is just one way that I can remind myself of his presence in my life. As much as I analyze it, I realize that I am very much like my dad. Really, I don&#39;t know why my dad wears shorts, but he is why I wear mine.<br />
	<br />
	So.....now you can stop wondering why.</p>
