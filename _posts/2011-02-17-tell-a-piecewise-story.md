	This journal article covers the concept of piecewise graphs, and the most effective way to introduce them to students. Rather than taking an algebraic approach (as most classrooms do), the article offers specific suggestions to help introduce confusing graphical concepts geometrically. The article then uses a story example to help illustrate their point. Students were given the following scenario:</div>
<div>
	<blockquote style="font-style: italic; ">
		Lissy walked to the corner store, which was less than a mile from her house. She got about halfway there and stopped to pick up a penny. She looked at it for a while. Then she started walking toward the corner store again, faster than before, to make up for lost time.</blockquote>
	The authors pointed out that rather than jumping in headfirst to equations, coordinates, and math concepts, the teacher should have students spend time developing a pictorial representation of the problem. Giving students creative freedom will allow you to see just exactly what the students know about the problem. After you have done that, the teacher used dynamic software to animate the motion in a cartesian graph (although the students didn&#39;t necessarily realize that). Rather than hounding on numbers and coordinates, the students were just asked to make conjectures about the steepness of the slopes. After these two steps were completed, the teacher finally made a connection between geometric interpretation of slope in which the speed was related to the relative steepness of the line instead of to an</div>

	I think that this strategy is a forward-thinking way to involve students and help them learn an incredibly important and vital mathematical concept. From my own educational experience, when I learned about piecewise linear functions, I felt very confident in what I had learned. However, many other students didn&#39;t share my confidence, and only understood the concept partially. This came back to bite them, as there are many other mathematical concepts which rely on knowing the basics on linear equations. This method allows students to represent the model in a way that is comfortable to them, and then repeatedly and slowly connecting it to the mathematical concepts. This would achieve a more polished understanding, and a more solid foundation when they do need to call on algebraic knowledge. I can see myself using this method in my novice teaching placement.</div>
