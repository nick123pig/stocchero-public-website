	I always was a fan of FMP. I actually liked having a class where you have no tests, no grades, you just have to go and learn. So when they offered an FMP course in college, I was the first to sign up. Anyways so we were doing the dreaded personality surveys. It&#39;s called the &quot;Meyers-Briggs&quot; survey, and it gives you 4 letter score. My score is an INTJ.<br />
	I - Introverted<br />
	N - iNtuitive<br />
	T - Thinking<br />
	J - Judging<br />
	<br />
	<a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/INTJ.html">Here is my personality profile</a>, and it is shockingly true. It&#39;s the first personality test that has actually made a little sense to me.<br />
	<br />
	My teacher looked at my score and was suprised that I was an Introvert. I didn&#39;t really know what to say. I went back to my dorm, and looked it up on google. That&#39;s when I found my new bible.<br />
