FMP

I always was a fan of FMP. I actually liked having a class where you have no tests, no grades, you just have to go and learn. So when they offered an FMP course in college, I was the first to sign up. Anyways so we were doing the dreaded personality surveys. It's called the "Meyers-Briggs" survey, and it gives you 4 letter score. My score is an INTJ.

- I - Introverted
- N - iNtuitive
- T - Thinking
- J - Judging

[Here is my personality profile](http://www.personalitypage.com/INTJ.html), and it is shockingly true. It's the first personality test that has actually made a little sense to me.

My teacher looked at my score and was suprised that I was an Introvert. I didn't really know what to say. I went back to my dorm, and looked it up on google. That's when I found my new bible.

This explains my life! I cannot relate/agree with Jon more. It helped me understand myself and others. FMP!

Anyways, Take the test, and leave a comment on what you are!
