<p>This post will be dedicated to the phenomoenon I like to call Cop Stop. We all know the deal, your driving along. There is a speeder (from now on named Emily) that passes you to the right. All of a sudden, a police man will be coming in the other direction. You look over to the Emily&#39;s Car, and 100% of the time, her taillights are fully illuminated, trying to get under the speed limit. Bam. One crazy decked out car makes a chronic speeder not speed. This is true in other aspects also. Say you have a teacher named Pavan. If he is doing a bad job teaching, he doesnt care. But as soon as the principal walks in, he acts like the best teacher in the world. I&#39;ll tell you this motivation ----&gt; Money. Pavan wants to keep his job, Emily doesnt want to pay a ticket. People will act nice when money is involoved. If you really want to know a person, see what they are doing when no one is looking.</p>
