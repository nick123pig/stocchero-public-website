Organization! I hate being organized! I live to be messy and in a rush! You could spend like four hours organizing stuff, but then you lose four hours of your life! I have a system that works good for me, and I like it! My surroundings are not complete pigpens, but they do have some messy parts. But that's A-OK! I find that people who are organize-freaks tend to be too into themselves. And when people come see my locker, they say "Wow, you are pretty unorganized", I can proudly say "Yes I am!". And that is what is so beautiful people!
