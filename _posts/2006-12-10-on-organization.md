<p>Organization! I hate being organized! I live to be messy and in a rush! You could spend like four hours organizing stuff, but then you lose four hours of your life! I have a system that works good for me, and I like it! My surroundings are not complete pigpens, but they do have some messy parts. But that&#39;s A-OK! I find that people who are organize-freaks tend to be too into themselves. And when people come see my locker, they say &quot;Wow, you are pretty unorganized&quot;, I can proudly say &quot;Yes I am!&quot;. And that is what is so beautiful people!</p>
