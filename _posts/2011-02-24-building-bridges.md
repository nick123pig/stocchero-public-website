		<blockquote>
			&nbsp;</blockquote>
		The purpose of the activities in the lesson are to have students take measurements from breaking strength of bridges, and then analyze the relationship between bridge length and breaking strength to determine if it is linear/non-linear and/or inverse. This is a hands on investigation to teach the concepts that every line is not simply linear and increasing. The teacher lists the 4 main purposes of this lesson to be:</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<blockquote>
		<div>
			1. express collected data in graphs and tables</div>
		<div>
			2. make predictions from their tables an graphs</div>
		<div>
			3. distinguish between linear and non-linear relationships</div>
		<div>
			4. begin to identify inverse relationships</div>

<p>Reflective Task 1: Describe the student-teacher interactions during the task debriefing discussions and assess the effectiveness of these interactions</p>

	<blockquote>
		The teacher is walking around during the lesson, and answering students who have their hand raised. This is an important first step; In my novice placement find myself walking around helping people who look stuck, or are struggling. However, sometimes I feel like they want to be left alone to figure the problem out themselves. The next thing I noticed about student-teacher interactions in the video was that every interaction was based around a question. She asked, &quot;why did you start at 4?&quot; instead of &quot;you start at 1 because of this.&quot; She asked, &quot;how does your data look after you graph it?&quot; instead of &quot;you draw a parabola because it&#39;s an exponential graph.&quot; You could see it in the students, they had to think about it, and then their &quot;Aha&quot; moment came to them. The student in the first video had to ask other clarifying questions before his &quot;Aha&quot; moment came to him.</blockquote>

		In the reflection from the teacher, she said the same thing as I felt in the first paragraph. She said that some students looked like they were hard at work doing their own thing, and she didn&#39;t want to infringe on their</blockquote>
	Personal Reflection 1: What criteria do you use to determine whether or not to use a particular task with your class?</div>

	<blockquote>
		In determining whether or not whether or not a criteria is important task to do, I would say that if there is a concrete, tangible purpose for the task, I would implement the task. If there is no purpose for the task, then I would not do that task. I think that this question is best answered using examples:</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		In my novice teaching placement, they often have &quot;extended response&quot; questions in their book that my teacher does not assign. She told me that rather than push the mathematical knowledge of the student, the questions do not extend or support any of the problems done in the book, they rather are just restatements of the answers that you found. In that case, my teacher almost never assigns them; she decides that there is no purpose for this task. I would follow a similar thought process.</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		For the situations when I have more than one high-quality, purposeful tasks, I would decide which tasks had the most &quot;bang for their buck.&quot; My criteria would include which tasks kept students engaged, and which tasks allowed students to discover the mathematical knowledge behind the task, rather than just being presented with it. As with everything, there are other factors that would go into that decision, but those would be my main criteria.</blockquote>

		Reflective Task 1: Describe the mathematical skills, concepts, and thinking processes that this lesson supports the development of. Discuss the significance of these skills, concepts, and processes in the overall development of mathematical understanding.</div>
	<div>
		<blockquote>
			I think the most important skill that the students develop in this lesson is making conjectures about the relationship between two variables. When the lesson begins, they don&#39;t know about non-linear relationships, nor do they know about inverse relationships. The concept of determining the relationship between two variables is the focus of almost every mathematics course between grades 7-12. This is a skill that one must constantly recall on throughout the rest of their mathematical careers.</blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			Another skill that this lesson develops is how to represent a relationship. The lesson plans that the students are comfortable in representing linear relationships in equation form. This lesson supports representing a relationship in graphical form, as well as table forms. Again, this is a critical concept to master before one can progress in their mathematical careers. There are multiple ways to solve every problem, and having the right representation can make all the difference.<br />
			<br />
			There are many other concepts and processes that are uncovered in this lesson, but I think these are the two most important, and the two that lay the foundation for most other mathematical skills and concepts</blockquote>

			Overall, I think that watching the video was good to see some concrete examples of effective teaching. The questions posed on the website really make you think about why you want to do something, and having those reasons outlined beforehand. However, I think there are more effective ways to accomplish this. Watching a video of someone else teach is no replacement for actually watching someone else teach. While I understand that it&#39;s not totally feasible, I think that doing a study like this in person would be much more effective.</div>
