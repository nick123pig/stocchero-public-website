<p>You know I sat here at my computer and typed a sentence, and then deleted it. I repeated that 5 times, when I said to myself, <span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;Nick --- This is stupid!&quot;</span> Why every time that I come up with a good idea, I shoot it down and trick myself to think it&#39;s not a good idea? HUH? Call me crazy, but I think I overthink what ever I am thinking. (How&#39;s that for repetition?) And therefore, I make this here promise to express my thinking. I also promise not to think about what other people think about my thoughts. (There is the repetition again). And I think this blog turned out a whole lot better than what it was going to be about (Creamed Corn) Thank goodness for thinking!</p>
