You know I sat here at my computer and typed a sentence, and then deleted it. I repeated that 5 times, when I said to myself, *"Nick --- This is stupid!"* 

Why every time that I come up with a good idea, I shoot it down and trick myself to think it's not a good idea? HUH? Call me crazy, but I think I overthink what ever I am thinking. (How's that for repetition?) And therefore, I make this here promise to express my thinking. I also promise not to think about what other people think about my thoughts. (There is the repetition again). And I think this blog turned out a whole lot better than what it was going to be about (Creamed Corn) Thank goodness for thinking!
