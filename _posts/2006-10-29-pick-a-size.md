<p class="MsoNormal">OK, So for some reason, I had to go to the grocery store to get some paper towels. So I walk in the door, and I waddle on over to the paper towel aisle (they have their own aisle). I am looking and looking for the best paper towel to suit my needs. I come across a strange brand. A large and BRAWNY man is staring slightly above my shoulder with his hands on his hips. It&#39;s called &quot;Brawny Pick-a-Size&quot;.<br />
	<br />
	Pick a Size. Hmmmm.<br />
	<br />
	I guess the geniuses up at corporate marketing say &quot;You can choose one sheet, two sheets, or three.&quot; Genius! No other paper towel company has ever even thought of this idea! The ironic thing is, that a 6-pack of these pick-a-size paper towels is $10.49! I will repeat that - $10.49!!!!!! This obviously makes the Pick-a-Size Version cost FOUR bucks more than every other non-size-picking versions on the market. They must think I am stupid. So, using reverse psychology, I bought the stupid &ldquo;pick-a-size&rdquo; paper towels just to say &quot;HA&quot; to those corporate idiots! HA!<br />

	But then, about 2 minutes later when I was driving home, I realized that reverse psychology sucks, and I am an idiot. Oh Well!</p>
