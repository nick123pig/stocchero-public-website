OK, So for some reason, I had to go to the grocery store to get some paper towels. So I walk in the door, and I waddle on over to the paper towel aisle (they have their own aisle). I am looking and looking for the best paper towel to suit my needs. I come across a strange brand. A large and BRAWNY man is staring slightly above my shoulder with his hands on his hips. It's called "Brawny Pick-a-Size".

Pick a Size. Hmmmm.

I guess the geniuses up at corporate marketing say "You can choose one sheet, two sheets, or three." Genius! No other paper towel company has ever even thought of this idea! The ironic thing is, that a 6-pack of these pick-a-size paper towels is $10.49! I will repeat that - $10.49!!!!!! This obviously makes the Pick-a-Size Version cost FOUR bucks more than every other non-size-picking versions on the market. They must think I am stupid. So, using reverse psychology, I bought the stupid "pick-a-size" paper towels just to say "HA" to those corporate idiots! HA!

But then, about 2 minutes later when I was driving home, I realized that reverse psychology sucks, and I am an idiot. Oh Well!
