<p>Educators know that students deepen their understanding while using manipulatives because they have to represent the mathematics using the manipulatives. Teachers can ask guiding questions as to how the manipulatives represent the mathematics behind it. For example, you can ask a student how holding up a mirror represents a reflection transformation. Teachers can informally assess whether or not students translate their skills from manipulatives to other situations. Teachers can do this in the many ways that they feel comfortable informally assessing.<br />

	When students work in groups, teachers can structure the activity so that each student has an active part in the activity. For example, you can assess students by having them present what they found, and specify that each student must present a certain aspect. Assessment is the key for holding students accountable while in groups. To assess each students depth of understanding, you would have to remove the student from the group to assess their knowledge. If the student has been participating in the group, then they should have no problem explaining or demonstrating their knowledge in the subject.<br />

	Again, using manipulatives can improve students&#39; problem solving skills by using the process standard of representation. They are improving their problem solving skills because they are using representations to model and interpret physical, social, and mathematical phenomena. Having practice and experience with this process standard helps students develop and feel more confident in their problem solving skills.</p>
